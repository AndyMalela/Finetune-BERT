"An estimate of the maximal computing power available to advanced extraterrestrial or future (post)human civilizations is presented. It is shown that the fundamental thermodynamical considerations may lead to a quantitative estimate of the largest quantity of information to be processed by conceivable computing devices. This issue is interesting from the point of view of physical eschatology, as well as general futurological topics, like the degree of confidence in long-term physical predictions or viability of the large-scale simulations of complex systems.","astronomy"
"We have obtained high-dispersion spectroscopy and BV photometry of two F-type eclipsing binaries, HD 71636 and V1022 Cas, plus the A-type system OT And. Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite measurements for each system have also been incorporated. The photometry of HD 71636 enables a more consistent picture of this 5.01331 days, circular-orbit system to emerge. The F2 V primary has a mass of 1.506 ± 0.002 M ☉ and a radius of 1.583 ± 0.024 R ☉. The mass of the F5 V secondary is 1.282 ± 0.002 M ☉, and its radius is 1.314 ± 0.030 R ☉. Comparison with evolutionary models of the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) series results in a good fit for a composition of [Fe/H] = 0.12 and an age of 0.9 Gyr. For the F6 V stars of V1022 Cas, our analysis produces a period of 12.15616 days and an eccentricity of 0.312. The two components have nearly equal masses of 1.626 ± 0.001 M ☉ and 1.607 ± 0.001 M ☉. The radii of the primary and secondary are 2.570 ± 0.021 R ☉ and 2.445 ± 0.022 R ☉, respectively. Comparison with the MESA evolutionary models results in [Fe/H] = 0.08 and an age of 1.87 Gyr. OT And consists of a pair of similar mid-A stars that have an orbital period of 20.85292 days and an eccentricity of 0.215. The primary has a mass of 2.253 ± 0.014 M ☉ and a radius of 3.167 ± 0.013 R ☉. The corresponding parameters for the secondary are 2.147 ± 0.011 M ☉ and 2.649 ± 0.015 R ☉, respectively. The MESA series models produce a best fit for this system with [Fe/H] = 0.10 and an age of 0.675 Gyr. The total apsidal motion in both eccentric systems is less than 1.°5 century−1.","astronomy"
"We present a (sub)millimeter line survey of the methanol maser outflow located in the massive star-forming region DR21(OH) carried out with the Submillimeter Array (SMA) at 217/227 GHz and 337/347 GHz. We find transitions from several molecules toward the maser outflow such as CH3OH, H2CS, C17O, H13CO+, and C34S. However, with the present observations, we cannot discard the possibility that some of the observed species such as C17O, C34S, and H2CS, might be instead associated with the compact and dusty continuum sources located in the MM2 region. Given that most of transitions correspond to methanol lines, we have computed a rotational diagram with CASSIS and an LTE synthetic spectra with XCLASS for the detected methanol lines in order to estimate the rotational temperature and column density in the small solid angle of the outflow where enough lines are present. We obtain a rotational temperature of 28 ± 2.5 K and a column density of 6.0 ± 0.9 × 1015 cm−2. These values are comparable to those column densities/rotational temperatures reported in outflows emanating from low-mass stars. Extreme and moderate physical conditions to excite the maser and thermal emission coexist within the CH3OH flow. Finally, we do not detect any complex molecules associated with the flow, e.g., CH3OCHO, (CH3)2CO, and CH3CH2CN.","astronomy"
"Concurrently with the maser flare observed in W51-North during the 3 month monitoring of H2O, NH3, and CH3OH maser variability from 2020 January to April using the Tianma 65 m Radio Telescope, we conducted Very Large Array mappings for these three maser species across the entirety of W51A region. After finding the ring-shaped H2O maser which might trace the disk surrounding the protostar residing in W51-North, the NH3 (9,6) maser delineated a jet which might be illuminated in the luminosity outburst possibly caused by the infalling streamer’s interaction with the protostar’s disk. An analysis of the comprehensive distribution of maser spots allowed us to affirm that W51N4 or ALMAmm31 serves as the primary source of the Lacy jet. Furthermore, we observed that class I methanol maser spots may extend beyond the locations of the H2O and NH3 (9,6) masers within the outflow. Additionally, emissions from other NH3 maser transitions coincided with specific 1.3 mm continuum sources. The arrangement of H2O maser spots in the vicinity of W51e2-E potentially indicates episodic accretions in this source. Combining the data from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array data archive for W51-North, W51e2, and W51e8, we have discovered that the H2O, NH3, and CH3OH masers, as well as the HC3N and SiO emissions are found to be good tools for tracing outflow in this work for W51A.","astronomy"
"The first detected interstellar object, ‘Oumuamua, which passed within 0.25 au of the Sun on 2017 September 9, was presumably ejected from a stellar system. We use its newly determined non-Keplerian trajectory together with the reconstructed Galactic orbits of 7 million stars from Gaia DR2 to identify past close encounters. Such an “encounter” could reveal the home system from which ‘Oumuamua was ejected. The closest encounter, at 0.60 pc (0.53–0.67 pc, 90% confidence interval), was with the M2.5 dwarf HIP 3757 at a relative velocity of 24.7 , 1 Myr ago. A more distant encounter (1.6 pc) but with a lower encounter (ejection) velocity of 10.7 was with the G5 dwarf HD 292249, 3.8 Myr ago. Two more stars have encounter distances and velocities intermediate to these. The encounter parameters are similar across six different non-gravitational trajectories for ‘Oumuamua. The ejection of ‘Oumuamua by scattering from a giant planet in one of the systems is plausible, but requires a rather unlikely configuration to achieve the high velocities found. A binary star system is more likely to produce the observed velocities. None of the four home candidates have published exoplanets or are known to be binaries. Given that the 7 million stars in Gaia DR2 with 6D phase space information is just a small fraction of all stars for which we can eventually reconstruct orbits, it is a priori unlikely that our current search would find ‘Oumuamua’s home star system. As ‘Oumuamua is expected to pass within 1 pc of about 20 stars and brown dwarfs every Myr, the plausibility of a home system also depends on an appropriate (low) encounter velocity.","astronomy"
"In the Nice model of Solar System formation, Uranus and Neptune undergo an orbital upheaval, sweeping through a planetesimal disk. The region of the disk from which material is accreted by the ice giants during this phase of their evolution has not previously been identified. We perform direct N-body orbital simulations of the four giant planets to determine the amount and origin of solid accretion during this orbital upheaval. We find that the ice giants undergo an extreme bombardment event, with collision rates as high as ∼3 per hour assuming km-sized planetesimals, increasing the total planet mass by up to ∼0.35%. In all cases, the initially outermost ice giant experiences the largest total enhancement. We determine that, for some plausible planetesimal properties, the resulting atmospheric enrichment could potentially produce sufficient latent heat to alter the planetary cooling timescale according to existing models. Our findings suggest that substantial accretion during this phase of planetary evolution may have been sufficient to impact the atmospheric composition and thermal evolution of the ice giants, motivating future work on the fate of deposited solid material.","astronomy"
"This paper presents a combined method of Gaussian mixture model and random forest to compute membership probabilities of stars by using large, high-dimensional data sets. A significant advantage of this method is that it allows us to easily identify likely cluster members in large data sets starting from small training samples. As a benchmark, we select 40318 stars in the field of the open cluster NGC 6405 from theGaiaData Release 2 (Gaia-DR2) by means of all five astrometric (positions, proper motions, and parallax) and photometric parameters. We use this combined method to determine likely cluster members in an eleven-dimensional parameter space. A total number of 518 high-probability (≥0.6) memberships are obtained, and the mean parallax and proper motion of the cluster are determined to be 2.171 ± 0.005 mas (461 ± 1 pc) and () = (−1.357 ± 0.023,−5.823 ± 0.020) mas yr−1, respectively. In addition, we quantitatively evaluate the relative importance of the parameters for membership determination and find that colors and magnitudes cannot be ignored in membership determination when using the RF method. Our results show that this combined method exhibits good performance in handling arbitrary high-dimensional and large data sets, such asGaia-DR2, and it can also be used to investigate other open clusters.","astronomy"
"We collected observational data on 781 Wolf–Rayet (WR) galaxies from the literature to photometrically study their infrared properties measured by the 2MASS, WISE, IRAS, AKARI, and Herschel missions. It is found that in the 1–5 μm range the radiations of WR galaxies are dominated by the free–free emissions from the stellar winds and the circumstellar dust from the late-type stars in the host galaxy. In the 5–22 μm range, the radiation of WR galaxies is dominated by the free–free emissions and the synchrotron radiation from the central active galactic nucleus (AGN; but not always present). In the 22–140 μm range, the radiations of WR galaxies are dominated by the free–free emissions and the star formation/starburst activities. In the 250–500 μm range, the radiation of WR galaxies is dominated by the free–free emissions. In addition, the comparison with the non-WR galaxies is made. It is shown that some star formation WR galaxies have redder near-infrared colors than non-WR star-forming galaxies probably due to the gas emission in the near-infrared. In the 2–5 μm region WR galaxies have redder colors due to the thermal emission from circumstellar dust of late-type stars and the enhanced gas emission. In the 5–22 μm region, both WR galaxies and non-WR galaxies have similar behavior, indicative of having similar free–free emission as the dominant radiation. In the 25–140 μm region, both types of galaxies also have similar behavior, indicative of having free–free emission from the stellar winds or the thermal radiation from the starburst/star formation as the dominant radiation.","astronomy"
"We present photometric data of the classical nova, V723 Cas (Nova Cas 1995), over a span of 10 years (2006 through 2016) taken with the 0.9 m telescope at Lowell Observatory, operated as the National Undergraduate Research Observatory (NURO) on Anderson Mesa near Flagstaff, Arizona. A photometric analysis of the data produced light curves in the optical bands (Bessel B, V, and R filters). The data analyzed here reveal an asymmetric light curve (steep rise to maximum, followed by a slow decline to minimum), the overall structure of which exhibits pronounced evolution including a decrease in magnitude from year to year, at the rate of ∼0.15 mag yr−1. We model these data with an irradiated secondary and an accretion disk with a hot spot using the eclipsing binary modeling program Nightfall. We find that we can model reasonably well each season of observation by changing very few parameters. The longitude of the hot spot on the disk and the brightness of the irradiated spot on the companion are largely responsible for the majority of the observed changes in the light curve shape and amplitude until 2009. After that, a decrease in the temperature of the white dwarf is required to model the observed light curves. This is supported by Swift/X-Ray Telescope observations, which indicate that nuclear fusion has ceased, and that V723 Cas is no longer detectable in the X-ray.","astronomy"
"We report precise radial velocity (RV) measurements of WASP-47, a G star that hosts three transiting planets in close proximity (a hot Jupiter, a super-Earth, and a Neptune-sized planet) and a non-transiting planet at 1.4 au. Through a joint analysis of previously published RVs and our own Keck-HIRES RVs, we significantly improve the planet mass and bulk density measurements. For the super-Earth WASP-47e (P = 0.79 days), we measure a mass of M ⊕, and a bulk density of g cm−3, consistent with a rocky composition. For the hot Jupiter WASP-47b (P = 4.2 days), we measure a mass of M ⊕ (1.12 ± 0.04 M Jup) and constrain its eccentricity to at 3σ confidence. For the Neptune-size planet WASP-47d (P = 9.0 days), we measure a mass of M ⊕ and a bulk density of g cm−3, suggesting that it has a thick H/He envelope. For the outer non-transiting planet, we measure a minimum mass of M ⊕ (1.29 ± 0.06 M Jup), an orbital period of days, and an orbital eccentricity of . Our new measurements are consistent with but two to four times more precise than previous mass measurements.","astronomy"
"A modified version of the folded aplanatic Gregory telescope equipped with a spherical two-lens corrector is proposed for observations requiring a high signal-to-noise ratio. The basic telescope model has an aperture of 400 mm (f/3.0), its field of view is 3.°0, the linear obscuration is 0.12, and the distortion is less than 0.5%. The focal surface has a spherical shape, and achieving a plane field requires an increase in the number of lenses in the corrector. The images of stars in the integrated wavelength range 0.35–1.0 μm are close to the diffraction-limited ones (D 80 = 5.9–8.2 μm = 1.″0–1.″4). The system is free from direct background illumination, and both the lens corrector and the light detector are protected from cosmic particles.","astronomy"
"Eclipsing binaries are instrumental to our understanding of fundamental stellar parameters. With the arrival of ultra-wide cameras and large area photometric monitoring programs, numerous eclipsing binaries systems have been reported photometrically. However, due to the expensive efforts to follow up spectroscopically, most of their basic properties remain unexplored. In this paper, we exploited the eclipsing binary light curves delivered by the all-sky catalina sky surveys, in tandem with the single shot spectroscopic survey from SDSS, and identify a double-lined M-dwarf eclipsing binary SDSSJ1156−0207. Because this system is very faint (V = 15.89 mag), we obtained follow-up radial velocity measurements using the Gemini Multi-object Spectrograph on board the Gemini North Telescope. This provides us with a spectral resolution R ∼ 4000, enabling us to determine the mass and radius of each of the stellar components when jointly fitted with light curve. Our best-fit results indicate that both components are from the M dwarf, with the primary component being and , while the secondary component is and . High-resolution spectroscopic observations in the future will help pin down the stellar parameters, providing insights into the stellar models at low-mass regimes, as well as sheding light on the internal structure of close-in low-mass objects and their inflation mechanism.","astronomy"
"The link between the International Celestial Reference Frame at radio wavelength and the forthcoming Gaia optical reference frame is a mandatory task after the completion of the Gaia mission. Starting from the provisional reference frame in which Gaia astrometric solutions were obtained, we discuss the ways to correct the residual rotation and acceleration effects and investigate three potential options for linking the two frames realized by extragalactic sources. We have estimated the accuracy for the frame alignment assuming different astrometric models of quasar proper motions observed by very long baseline interferometry (VLBI). Using about 500,000 high-precision proper motions of extragalactic sources, the residual rotation of the Gaia reference frame is evaluated under 1 μas yr−1. In view of its favorable properties, Gaia should be given priority to be considered as the future fundamental reference frame that is consistent with the principle of the International Celestial Reference System. The VLBI reference frame can be linked to Gaia based on thousands of common quasars with an accuracy of 10 μas for each axis.","astronomy"
"One source of error in high-precision radial velocity measurements of exoplanet host stars is chromatic change in Earth’s atmospheric transmission during observations. Mitigation of this error requires that the photon-weighted barycentric correction be applied as a function of wavelength across the stellar spectrum. We have designed a system for chromatic photon-weighted barycentric corrections with the EXtreme PREcision Spectrograph and present results from the first year of operations, based on radial velocity measurements of more than 103 high-resolution stellar spectra. For observation times longer than 250 s, we find that if the chromatic component of the barycentric corrections is ignored, a range of radial velocity errors up to 1 m s−1 can be incurred with cross-correlation, depending on the nightly atmospheric conditions. For this distribution of errors, the standard deviation is 8.4 cm s−1 for G-type stars, 8.5 cm s−1 for K-type stars, and 2.1 cm s−1 for M-type stars. This error is reduced to well-below the instrumental and photon-noise limited floor by frequent flux sampling of the observed star with a low-resolution exposure meter spectrograph.","astronomy"
"It is well-known that fitting Color–Magnitude Diagrams (CMDs) to theoretical isochrones is the main method to determine star cluster ages. However, when CMDs are not available, the Spectral Energy Distribution (SED)-fitting technique is the only other approach, although it suffers the age–metallicity–reddening degeneracy. In this work, we gather the ages, metallicities, and masses of dozens of M31 star clusters from the CMD-fitting with Hubble Space Telescope images from the literature for comparison. We check the reliability of the SED-fitting results with different models, i.e., Bruzual &amp; Charlot model (BC03), Galaxy Evolutionary Synthesis Models (GALEV), and Advanced Stellar Population Synthesis (ASPS) for the simple stellar populations (SSPs) with single stars (ss)-SSP/binary-star (bs)-SSPs models. The photometry bands includes the Galaxy Evolution Explorer GALEX FUV/NUV bands, optical/near-infrared UBVRIJHK bands, as well as the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) W1/W2 bands. The comparisons show that the SED-fitting ages agree well with the CMD-fitting ages, either with the fixed metallicity or with the free metallicity for both the BC03 and the GALEV model. However, for the ASPS models, it seems that SED-fitting results are systematically older than the CMD ages, especially for the ages log t &lt; 9.0 (year). The fitting also shows that the GALEX FUV/NUV-band are more important than the WISE W1/W2 for constraining the ages, which confirms the previous findings. We also derived the masses of our sample star clusters from the BC03 and GALEV models and it is found that the values agree well with those in the literature.","astronomy"
"Light-curve inversion (LI) is a powerful imaging technique and widely used in stellar surface imaging and starspot reconstruction. It can be used to reconstruct a high-resolution image from a light curve of a star via the conversion from temporal resolution to spatial resolution. However, as an ill-posed problem, accurate resulting spot-to-photosphere brightness ratio (SBR) is hard to achieve because of the limitation of the single regularization of the traditional LI method. To address the existing problems, we propose a new method, namely LI with bipartite regularization (LIBR), to extend the capability of LI. This new method employs adaptive SBR adjustment in each iteration of the fitting process to obtain accurate intensity distribution. As shown in the simulations, the SBR produced by the LIBR method indicates that the model can mimic the actual stellar surface as closely as possible. Therefore, it becomes possible to be used for analyzing starspots from massive high-quality observed data derived from the Kepler Space Telescope and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite.","astronomy"
"Two mathematical models of three bodies of variable masses are used to obtain a qualitative description of two interacting galaxies with mass exchange and mass loss. The reference system is centered on the largest body (the most massive galaxy), and the other two bodies are allowed to move around this one under the laws of gravity. The third body, which simulated the mass lost by the second galaxy in the form of a tail, increases its mass due to the mass lost by the second body and follows its trajectory. We are interested in knowing the time evolution of the separation of the two bulges of the interacting galaxies, and the parameters for the analytical models are obtained by running simulations with the GADGET-2 N-body code. The resulting behavior of this distance in our mathematical models is qualitatively in good agreement with that obtained by this code.","astronomy"
"The results of classical CCD observations for 371 double or multiple stars (450 pairs) obtained at both, Serbian Astronomical Station on the mountain of Vidojevica (ASV) and Bulgarian National Astronomical Observatory at Rozhen (NAOR) are presented. At ASV the observations were performed with the 0.6 m telescope in the first half of 2016 during 11 nights, and with the newly mounted 1.4 m telescope in the second half of 2016 during 16 nights. At NAOR, the observations were performed with the 2 m telescope during four nights. In this paper, we present 477 measurements (position angle and angular separation) for these 450 pairs. Among them there are 41 pairs with published orbital or linear elements and residuals are given for them. Some pairs have measurements for several epochs. Our observed pairs have angular separations in the interval from 1.″60 to 190.″30, with a mean angular separation of 14.″87 and a median value of 4.″34. Two new pairs and linear elements for four pairs which are calculated for the first time are also presented.","astronomy"
"We present detailed analyses of updated eclipse timing diagrams for 32 contact binary merger candidates in the Galactic bulge. The photometric data was obtained from 2016 to 2021 using the Korea Microlensing Telescope Network with the 1.6 m telescopes located at three southern sites (CTIO, SAAO, and SSO). The times of minimum lights were determined by applying the binary-star model to full light curves created at half-year intervals from the observations. The orbital period variations of the binary systems were analyzed using the O − C diagrams from our new timings with the others published in the literature, which are based on the OGLE observations from 2001 to 2015. As results, the orbital periods and period-decreasing rates of 32 binary systems were located to be in the ranges of 0.370 to 1.238 days and from −3.0 to −13.1 × 10−6 day yr−1, respectively. Out of these stars, 24 systems show a combination effect of a parabola and a light travel time caused by a third body, and their outer orbital periods are in the range of 9.1–26.5 yr. We propose that all of our merger candidates need additional monitoring observations to study a luminous-red nova progenitor.","astronomy"
"We present orbital elements for 22 single-line binaries, nine of them studied for the first time, determined from a joint spectroscopic and astrometric solution. The astrometry is based on interferometric measurements obtained with the HRCam Speckle camera on the SOAR 4.1 m telescope at Cerro Pachon, Chile, supplemented with historical data. The spectroscopic observations were secured using Echelle spectrographs (FEROS, FIDEOS, and HARPS) at La Silla, Chile. A comparison of our orbital elements and systemic velocities with previous studies, including Gaia radial velocities, shows the robustness of our estimations. By adopting suitable priors of the trigonometric parallax and spectral type of the primary component, and using a Bayesian inference methodology developed by our group, we were able to estimate mass ratios for these binaries. Combining the present results with a previous study of other single-line binaries from our team, we present a pseudo mass-to-luminosity relationship based on 23 systems (46 stars) in the mass range 0.6 ≤ M ⊙ ≤ 2.5. We find a reasonable correspondence with a fiducial mass-to-luminosity relationship. We conclude that our methodology does allow us to derive tentative mass ratios for these types of binaries.","astronomy"
"We propose a novel exact method to solve the probabilistic catalog matching problem faster than previously possible. Our new approach uses mixed integer programming and introduces quadratic constraints to shrink the problem by multiple orders of magnitude. We also provide a method to use a feasible solution to dramatically speed up our algorithm. This gain in performance is dependent on how close to optimal the feasible solution is. Also, we are able to provide good solutions by stopping our mixed integer programming solver early. Using simulated catalogs, we empirically show that our new mixed integer program with quadratic constraints is able to be set up and solved much faster than previous large linear formulations. We also demonstrate our new approach on real-world data from the Hubble Source Catalog. This paper is accompanied by publicly available software to demonstrate the proposed method.","astronomy"
"In this study, we introduced a quantitative parameter, the magnetic field strength difference, to denote the intensity of the magnetic pileup effect at Mars. Using a three-dimensional multispecies MHD model, the effects of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) and the solar wind dynamic pressure (P d ) constituted with different densities and velocities on the magnetic pileup were examined. Our results show that: (1) the magnetic pileup at Mars mainly occurs at the dayside region and its magnitude is generally decreasing with increasing solar zenith angle. The magnetic pileup is generally weak in the intense crustal field region, while it is strong in the weak crustal field region. (2) The perpendicular IMF components, B Y and B Z , dominate the magnetic pileup, while the radial IMF component, B X , has little effect. In the intense crustal field region, when the IMF and crustal field are primarily in the same direction, the magnetic field is piled up and the pileup magnitude is generally strong. While the directions of the crustal field and IMF are opposite, the occurrence of magnetic reconnection can weaken the local magnetic pileup. (3) Under the same P d , a higher solar wind velocity results in a higher intensity and a larger region of the magnetic pileup. When P d increases, the magnitude of the magnetic pileup is enhanced, but the pileup region shrinks. In addition, for an increasing P d , at the center of the induced magnetotail, the asymmetric current sheet can lead to similar asymmetries of the pileup.","astronomy"
"High-resolution spectra with iSHELL on IRTF in the K and M bands of the young, heavily accreting B1.5Ve star MWC 297 show numerous double-peaked CO lines. These CO lines originate in an inclined gaseous disk in Keplerian rotation. MWC 297 is the only early B star known to show a Keplerian disk in CO. Analysis of the spectra shows that 12CO 1–0 is optically thick for the low excitation lines. Even the 13CO 1–0 and 12CO 2–1 have somewhat optically thick lines at low J levels. We find that the CO emission in the disk can be fitted with CO being in a narrow ring at a radius of 12 au, with a temperature of 1500 K and a CO column density of 1.6 × 1018 cm−2. This model underestimates the line strength of high-J lines, indicating that they are excited by fluorescence. The CO overtone lines have a similar temperature. The 13CO lines are much brighter than expected from interstellar isotope ratios. The 13CO lines are wider than the 12CO ones, suggesting different excitation conditions. The same is true for 12CO 2–1. We see strong absorption in 12CO and 13CO 1–0 at low J levels, which is due to two cold foreground clouds. These clouds, one with a temperature of 8.3 K and a column density of 6.7 1017 cm−2 and the other one colder and with lower column density, can fully account for the observed extinction toward MWC 297.","astronomy"
"We present a comprehensive analysis of a very long-period (124.93669 days) eclipsing binary KIC 9028474, which is composed of F9V+G1V components on a highly eccentric (e = 0.82029) orbit. Masses and radii of the primary and the secondary components are M 1 = 1.18 ± 0.04 M ⊙, M 2 = 1.04 ± 0.03 M ⊙, R 1 = 1.52 ± 0.02 R ⊙, and R 2 = 1.11 ± 0.01 R ⊙, respectively. Eclipse time variations show the presence of apsidal motion, which in turn shows the existence of a third body in a relatively close orbit. Simultaneous analysis of infrared spectra and space photometry reveals that the primary component is about to leave the main sequence, indicating an age of 5.2 ± 0.8 Gyr for the system. Theoretical evaluation of the observed eccentricity indicates that the components of KIC 9028474 will end their whole life much before the orbital circularization is achieved. Given the limited resolution of the spectra, we can only place an upper limit on the rotational velocities of each star, thus a theoretical evaluation of the synchronization of the components.","astronomy"
"Orbit flips have been previously found under the eccentric Lidov–Kozai effect (ELK) in hierarchical three-body systems. Recently, we have found that, in certain conditions, the orbit can flip its orientation in a much different manner, where the stellar oblateness plays an important role. In this paper, orbit-flip behaviors with the ELK effect are investigated as the stellar oblateness varies within a wide range. This is of significance because recent works have shown that the oblateness of young stars has a widespread distribution and may have critical effects on sculpting the final orbital states of close-in planets. Our dynamical model includes the secular potential of the perturber to octupole order and the secular effects of the stellar oblateness. An alignment between the orbit plane of the outer perturber and the stellar bulge is assumed. Our findings mainly consist of two aspects. (i) A new type of orbit-flipping mechanism induced by a combination of the ELK and stellar oblateness effects, referred to as the ELK–J 2 effect, is discovered and confirmed. (ii) We demonstrate that, in the considered aligned configuration, the stellar oblateness suppresses orbit flips due to the ELK effect and produces new flips through the ELK–J 2 effect. Moreover, if the stellar oblateness perturbations are of the same order as the octupole perturbations of the outer perturber, the ELK-induced orbit flips are almost entirely suppressed, while the ELK–J 2 effect reaches its peak for the considered strength of the octupole perturbations. However, from a global view, stellar oblateness always reduces flipping orbits.","astronomy"
"Characterizing rocky exoplanet atmospheres is a key goal of exoplanet science, but interpreting such observations will require understanding the stellar ultraviolet (UV) irradiation incident on the planet from its host star. Stellar UV mediates atmospheric escape, photochemistry, and planetary habitability, and observations of rocky exoplanets can only be understood in the context of the UV spectral energy distribution (SED) of their host stars. Particularly important are SEDs from observationally favorable but poorly understood low-mass M-dwarf stars, which are the only plausible targets for rocky planet atmospheric characterization for the next 1–2 decades. In this work, we explore the utility of AstroSat UltraViolet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) for the characterization of the UV SEDs of low-mass stars. We present observations of the nearby M0 star HIP 23309 in the far-UV (FUV) and near-UV (NUV) gratings of UVIT. Our FUV spectra are consistent with contemporaneous Hubble Space Telescope (HST) data and our NUV spectra are stable between orbits, suggesting UVIT is a viable tool for the characterization of the SEDs of low-mass stars. We apply our measured spectra to simulations of photochemistry and habitability for a hypothetical rocky planet orbiting HIP 23309 and elucidate the utility and limitations of UVIT in deriving UV SEDs of M-dwarf exoplanet hosts. Our work validates UVIT as a tool to complement HST in the characterization of exoplanet host stars and carries implications for its successor missions like INSIST.","astronomy"
"The results of 3611 intensified CCD observations of double stars, made with the 26 inch refractor of the U.S. Naval Observatory, are presented. Each observation of a system represents a combination of over 2000 short-exposure images. These observations are averaged into 1857 mean relative positions and range in separation from 0.″341 to 128.″644, with a median separation of 6.″533. Two systems have their orbits improved and one has its first determination. This is the 24th in this series of papers and covers the period 2018 May 24 through 2019 October 28.","astronomy"
"The evanescent wave coronagraph uses the principle of frustrated total internal reflection (FTIR) to suppress the light coming from the star and study its close environment. Its focal plane mask is composed of a lens and a prism placed in contact with each other to produce the coronagraphic effect. In this paper, we present the experimental results obtained using an upgraded focal plane mask of the Evanescent Wave Coronagraph (EvWaCo). These experimental results are also compared to the theoretical performance of the coronagraph obtained through simulations. Experimentally, we reach a raw contrast equal to a few 10−4 at a distance equal to 3 λ/D over the full I band (λ c = 800 nm, Δλ/λ ≈ 20%) and equal to 4 λ/D over the full R band (λ c = 650 nm, Δλ/λ ≈ 23%) in unpolarized light. However, our simulations show a raw contrast close to 10−4 over the full I band and R band at the same distance, thus confirming the theoretical achromatic advantage of the coronagraph. We also verify the stability of the mask through a series of contrast measurements over a period of 8 months. Furthermore, we measure the sensitivity of the coronagraph to the lateral and longitudinal misalignment of the focal plane mask and to the lateral misalignment of the Lyot stop.","astronomy"
"The supernova remnant (SNR) B0532−67.5 in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) was first diagnosed by its nonthermal radio emission, and its SNR nature was confirmed by the observation of diffuse X-ray emission; however, no optical SNR shell is detected. The OB association LH75, or NGC 2011, is projected within the boundary of this SNR. We have analyzed the massive star population in and around SNR B0532−67.5 using optical photometric data to construct color–magnitude diagrams, using stellar evolutionary tracks to estimate stellar masses, and using isochrones to assess the stellar ages. From these analyses, we find a 20–25 Myr population in LH75 and a younger population less than 10 Myr old to the southwest of LH75. The center of SNR B0532−67.5 is located closer to the core of LH75 than to the massive stars to its southwest. We conclude that the supernova progenitor was probably a member of LH75 with an initial mass of ∼15 M ⊙. The supernova exploded in an H i cavity excavated by the energy feedback of LH75. The low density of the ambient medium prohibits the formation of a visible nebular shell. Despite the low density in the ambient medium, physical properties of the hot gas within the SNR interior do not differ from SNRs with a visible shell by more than a factor of 2–3. The large-scale H i map shows that SNR B0532−67.5 is projected in a cavity that appears to be connected with the much larger cavity of the supergiant shell LMC-4.","astronomy"
"The ancient Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) globular cluster NGC 2005 has recently been reported to have an ex situ origin, thus, setting precedents that the LMC could have partially formed from smaller merged dwarf galaxies. We here provide additional arguments from which we conclude that is also fairly plausible an in situ origin of NGC 2005, based on the abundance spread of a variety of chemical elements measured in dwarf galaxies, their minimum mass in order to form globular clusters, the globular cluster formation imprints kept in their kinematics, and the recent modeling showing that explosions of supernovae are responsible for the observed chemical abundance spread in dwarf galaxies. The present analysis points to the need for further development of numerical simulations and observational indices that can help us to differentiate between two mechanisms of galaxy formation for the LMC; namely, a primordial dwarf or an initial merging event of smaller dwarfs.","astronomy"
"Correlations of polarization components in the coordinate frame are a natural basis for searches of parity-violating modes in the cosmic microwave background. This fact can be exploited to build estimators of parity-violating modes that are local and robust with respect to partial-sky coverage or inhomogeneous weighting. As an example application of a method based on these ideas, we develop a peak stacking tool that isolates the signature of parity-violating modes. We apply the tool to Planck maps and obtain a constraint on the monopole of the polarization rotation angle at 95% We also demonstrate how the tool can be used as a local method for reconstructing maps of direction dependent rotation .","astronomy"
"The open cluster IC 1369, located in Cygnus close to the galactic equator at the 89.°6 longitude, and its vicinity are investigated by applying two-dimensional photometric classification of stars down to V = 19 mag measured in the Vilnius seven-color photometric system. Employing the Gaia DR2 coordinates, parallaxes, and proper motions, 143 cluster members are found having cluster membership probabilities ≥0.75. The hottest stars of the evolved main sequence are of spectral class B9. Distances to the cluster, determined by two methods based on the Gaia parallaxes, are 3280 and 3370 pc with an uncertainty of 400–500 pc. Employing the physical HR diagram with the coordinates versus and the Padova isochrones, the cluster age is found to be between 300 and 350 Myr. Among the cluster members we identified six red giants of spectral classes G5–G8 and luminosities II–III, 17 Am stars, one Ap star, and one B5 blue straggler. The extinction shows a steep rise up to ∼2.0 mag at 300–700 pc, caused by the extensions of the dust cloud LDN 970 and the Great Cygnus Rift, and up to ∼2.5 mag at the edge of the Perseus arm at 3.0 kpc. The extinction is almost constant between 0.9 and 2.5 kpc from the Sun. The average extinction of the cluster members is 2.54 mag. A systematic error of color excesses found in the Argonaut calculator results is discussed.","astronomy"
"ER Ursae Majoris is the prototype for a subset of SU UMa-type dwarf novae characterized by short cycle times between outburst, high outburst frequency, and negative superhumps. It suffers superoutbursts every 43 days, lasting 20 days, normal outbursts every 4 days, and has an outburst amplitude of 3 mag. We have carried out a far-ultraviolet (FUV) spectral analysis of ER UMa in quiescence, by fitting Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer and International Ultraviolet Explorer spectra with model accretion disks and high-gravity photosphere models. Using the Gaia parallax distance and an orbital inclination of 50°, we find that during the brief quiescence of only four days, the accretion rate is 7.3 × 10−11 M ⊙ yr−1, with the ER UMa white dwarf contributing 55% of the FUV flux and the accretion disk contributing the remaining 45% of the flux. The white dwarf in ER UMa is markedly hotter (32,000 K) than the other white dwarfs in dwarf novae below the cataclymic variable (CV) period gap, which have typical temperatures of ∼15,000 K. For higher inclinations of 60°–75°, the accretion rates that we derive are roughly an order of magnitude higher, (1–3) × 10−10 M ⊙ yr−1.","astronomy"
"We report NASA-DLR SOFIA upGREAT circumstellar [O i] 63.2 μm and [C ii] 157.7 μm emission profiles and FIFI-LS [O i] 63.2 μm, [O i] 145.5 μm, and [C ii] 157.7 μm fluxes obtained shortly after Betelgeuse’s 2019/2020 Great Dimming event. Haas et al. noted a potential correlation between the [O i] 63.2 μm flux and V magnitude based on three Kuiper Airborne Observatory observations made with the CGS and FIFI instruments. The FIFI observation was obtained when V ≃ 0.88 and revealed a 3σ non-detection at a quarter of the previous CGS flux measurement made when V ≃ 0.35. A potential explanation could be a change in dust-gas drag heating by circumstellar silicates caused by variations in the photospheric radiation field. SOFIA observations provide a unique test of this correlation because the V-band brightness went to its lowest value on record, V ≃ 1.61, with the SOFIA observations being made when V FIFI−LS ≃ 1.51 and V upGREAT ≃ 1.36. The upGREAT spectra show a [O i] 63.2 μm flux larger than previous space observatory measurements obtained when V ≃ 0.58. The profile is consistent with formation in the slower, more turbulent inner S1 outflow, while the [C ii] 157.7 μm profile is consistent with formation farther out in the faster S2 outflow. Modeling of dust-gas drag heating, combined with 25 yr of Wing three-filter and V photometry, reveals that it is unlikely that the S1 circumstellar envelope and [O i] 63.2 μm fluxes are dominated by the dust-gas drag heating and that another heating source is also active. The [O i] 63.2 μm profile is hard to reconcile with existing outflow velocity models.","astronomy"
"We have developed a general statistical procedure for analysis of 2D and 3D finite patterns, which is applied to the data from recently released Gaia-ESA catalog DR2. The 2D analysis clearly confirms our former results on the presence of binaries in the former DR1 catalog. Our main objective is the statistical 3D analysis of DR2. For this, it is essential that the DR2 catalog includes parallaxes and data on the proper motion. The analysis allows us to determine for each pair of stars the probability that it is the binary star. This probability is represented by the function depending on the separation. Furthermore, a combined analysis of the separation with proper motion provides a clear picture of binaries with two components of the motion: parallel and orbital. The result of this analysis is an estimate of the average orbital period and mass of the binary system. The catalog we have created involves 80,560 binary candidates.","astronomy"
"Since its discovery in 1995, V2400 Ophiuchi (V2400 Oph) has stood apart from most known intermediate polar cataclysmic variables due to its proposed magnetic field strength (9–27 MG) and diskless accretion. To date, the exact accretion mechanism of the system is still unknown, and standard accretion models fail to accurately predict the peculiar behavior of its light curve. We present the K2 Campaign 11 light curve of V2400 Oph recording 74.19 days of photometric data cadenced at 1 minute. The light curve is dominated by aperiodic flickering and quasiperiodic oscillations, which make the beat and spin signals inconspicuous on short timescales. Notably, a log–log full power spectrum shows a break frequency at ∼102 cycles d−1 similar to some disk-fed systems. Through power-spectral analysis, the beat and spin periods are measured as 1003.4 ± 0.2 s and 927.7 ± 0.1 s, respectively. A power spectrum of the entire K2 observation demonstrates beat period dominance. However, time-resolved power spectra reveal a strong dependence between observation length and the dominant frequency of the light curve. For short observations (2–12 hr) the beat, spin, or first beat harmonic can be observed as the dominant periodic signal. Such incoherence and variability indicate a dynamical accretion system more complex than current intermediate polar theories can explain. We propose that a diamagnetic blob accretion model may serve as a plausible explanation for the accretion mechanism.","astronomy"
"We study the radio and optical properties of the brightest group galaxies (BGGs) in a sample of galaxy groups from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR7. The luminosity difference between the BGG and the second-ranked galaxy in the group (known as the luminosity, or magnitude, gap) has been used as a probe for the level of galaxy interaction for the BGG within the group. We study the properties of BGGs with magnitude gaps in the range of 0–2.7 mag, in order to investigate any relation between the luminosity gap and the radio properties of the BGG. In order to eliminate selection biases, we ensure that all variations in stellar mass are accounted for. We then confirm that, at fixed stellar mass, there are no significant variations in the optical properties of the BGGs over the full range of luminosity gaps studied. We compare these optical results with the Evolution and Assembly of GaLaxies and their Environments (EAGLE) hydrodynamical simulations and find broad consistency with the observational data. Using EAGLE we also confirm that no trends begin to arise in the simulated data at luminosity gaps beyond our observational limits. Finally, we find that, at a fixed stellar mass, the fraction of BGGs that are radio-loud also shows no trend as a function of luminosity gap. We examine how the BGG offset from the center of the group may affect the radio results and find no significant trend for the fraction of radio-loud BGGs with a magnitude gap in either the BGG samples with greater or less than 100 kpc offset from the center of the group.","astronomy"
"Integral field spectroscopy can map astronomical objects spatially and spectroscopically. Due to instrumental and atmospheric effects, it is common for integral field instruments to yield a sampling of the sky image that is both irregular and wavelength dependent. Most subsequent analysis procedures require a regular, wavelength-independent sampling (for example a fixed rectangular grid), and thus an initial step of fundamental importance is to resample the data onto a new grid. The best possible resampling would produce a well-sampled image, with a resolution equal to that imposed by the intrinsic spatial resolution of the instrument, telescope, and atmosphere, and with no statistical correlations between neighboring pixels. A standard method in the field to produce a regular set of samples from an irregular set of samples is Shepard’s method, but Shepard’s method typically yields images with a degraded resolution and large statistical correlations between pixels. Here we introduce a new method, which improves on Shepard’s method in both these respects. We apply this method to data from the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory survey, part of Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV, demonstrating a full width at half maximum close to that of the intrinsic spatial resolution (and ∼16% better than Shepard’s method) and low statistical correlations between pixels. These results nearly achieve the ideal resampling. This method can have broader applications to other integral field data sets and to other astronomical data sets (such as dithered images) with irregular sampling.","astronomy"
"We present Brγ emission line kinematics of the nuclear region of NGC 253, recently known to host a strong galactic wind that limits the global star formation of the galaxy. We obtained high-resolution long-slit spectroscopic data with PHOENIX at Gemini South, positioning the slit on the nucleus infrared core (IRC), close to the nuclear disk major axis. The spatial resolution was 0.″35 (∼6 pc) and the slit length was 14″ (∼240 pc). The spectral resolution was ∼74,000, unprecedentedly high for galactic nuclei observations at ∼2.1 μm. The line profiles appear highly complex, with blue asymmetry up to 3.″5 away of the IRC, and red asymmetries further away to northeast. Several Gaussian components are necessary to fit the profile, nevertheless a narrow and a wide one predominate. The IRC presents kinematic widths above 700 km s−1 (FWZI), and broad component FWHM ∼ 400 km s−1, the highest detected in a nearby galaxy. At the IRC, the blueshifted broad component displays a 90 km s−1 bump in radial velocity distribution, a feature we previously detected in molecular gas kinematics. The narrow component velocity dispersion (∼32 km s−1) is within the expected for normal galaxies and luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs). Intermediate components (FWHM ∼ 150 km s−1, redshifted to the northeast, blueshifted to the southwest) appear at some positions, as well as weaker blue (−215 km s−1) and red line wings (+300 km s−1). The IRC depicts a large broad-versus-narrow line flux ratio (F(B)/F(N) ∼ 1.35), and the broad component seems only comparable with those observed at very high star-forming rate galaxies. The results indicate that the IRC would be the main source of the galactic winds originated in the central region of NGC 253.","astronomy"
"A nonlinear solution for the gaseous component of a galactic disk has been derived self-consistently using fluid description and reductive perturbation theory. We show that gas follows a spiral pattern, similarly to the stellar component; but the spirals are slightly separated due to different relevant parameters, as observations suggest. This analytical solution provides an additional contribution to a better understanding of rotation velocity curves of spiral galaxies. Since the proposed approach, and consequently solution, can be used in various astrophysical dynamical systems, we keep as general as possible a form of the calculus. We underline differences between the stellar and gaseous cases, and we apply this solution roughly on the gaseous disk component dynamics pointing out the importance of the nonlinear approach.","astronomy"
"A detailed analysis of ground-based CCD UBV photometry and space-based Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3) data for the open clusters King 6 and NGC 1605 was performed. Using the pyUPMASK algorithm on Gaia astrometric data to estimate cluster membership probabilities, we have identified 112 stars in King 6 and 160 stars in NGC 1605 as the statistically most likely members of each cluster. We calculated reddening and metallicity separately using UBV two-color diagrams to estimate parameter values via independent methods. The color excess E(B − V) and photometric metallicity [Fe/H] for King 6 are 0.515 ± 0.030 mag and 0.02 ± 0.20 dex, respectively. For NGC 1605, they are 0.840 ± 0.054 mag and 0.01 ± 0.20 dex, respectively. With reddening and metallicity kept constant, we have estimated the distances and cluster ages by fitting PARSEC isochrones to color–magnitude diagrams based on the Gaia and UBV data. The photometric distances are 723 ± 34 pc for King 6 and 3054 ± 243 pc for NGC 1605. The cluster ages are 200 ± 20 Myr and 400 ± 50 Myr for King 6 and NGC 1605, respectively. The mass function slopes were found to be 1.29 ± 0.18 and 1.63 ± 0.36 for King 6 and NGC 1605, respectively. These values are in good agreement with the value of Salpeter. The relaxation times were estimated as 5.8 Myr for King 6 and 60 Myr for NGC 1605. These indicate that both clusters are dynamically relaxed since these times are less than the estimated cluster ages. A Galactic orbit analysis shows that both clusters formed outside the solar circle and are members of the young thin-disk population.","astronomy"
"The long arc and high-quality astrometric measurements of outer irregular satellites are prerequisites for improving their orbital theories and increasing the precision of their ephemerides. In order to obtain good astrometric positions of Himalia, the largest irregular satellite of Jupiter, we have processed and reduced 911 ground-based CCD frames obtained between 2015 and 2021 by three telescopes (including 1 and 2.4 m telescopes at Yunnan Observatory, and 0.8 m telescope at Purple Mountain Observatory) over 61 nights. Subtracting off the companion star of our target by constructing an effective point-spread function (ePSF) model in some CCD frames, the ePSF-subtracted technique is used to reduce the centering error. Some additional techniques are applied in data reduction to further improve positional accuracy and precision of Himalia. This includes geometric distortion correction, weighted polynomial plate models, and the precision-premium effect, since their relative positional measurements have better precision when two objects are very near (e.g., less than 60″). The star catalog Gaia DR2 is used for astrometric calibration, and theoretical positions of Himalia are retrieved from JPL Horizons ephemeris, including the satellite ephemeris Jup344 and the newest planetary ephemeris DE441. Our results show the mean (O − C)s (observed minus computed) of the positional residuals of Himalia are −0.""004 and 0.″005 in R.A. and decl., respectively, and their corresponding standard deviations are about 0.″020 in each direction.","astronomy"
"There is a small group of peculiar early-type stars on the main sequence that show different rotation velocities from different spectral lines. This inconsistency might be due to the binary nature of these objects. We aim to verify this hypothesis by a more detailed spectroscopic and photometric investigation of one such object: HD 183986. We obtained 151 high- and medium-resolution spectra that covered an anticipated long orbital period. There is clear evidence of the orbital motion of the primary component. We uncovered a very faint and broad spectrum of the secondary component. The corresponding SB2 orbital parameters, and the component spectra, were obtained by Fourier disentangling using the KOREL code. The component spectra were further modeled by iSpec code to arrive at the atmospheric quantities and the projected rotational velocities. We have proven that this object is a binary star with a period P = 1268.2(11) days, eccentricity e = 0.5728(20), and mass ratio q = 0.655. The primary component is a slowly rotating star ( v sin i = 27 km s−1) while the cooler and less massive secondary rotates much faster ( v sin i ∼ 120 km s−1). Photometric observations obtained by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) satellite were also investigated to shed more light on this object. A multiperiod photometric variability was detected in the TESS data ranging from hours (the δ Sct-type variability) to a few days (spots/rotational variability). The physical parameters of the components and the origin of the photometric variability are discussed in more detail.","astronomy"
"T Aurigae is an eclipsing old nova that exploded in 1891. At a Gaia EDR3 distance of 815–871 pc, it is a relatively nearby old nova. Through ultraviolet spectral modeling and using the new precise Gaia distance, we find that the HST/STIS spectrum of T Aurigae is consistent with an accretion disk with a mass-transfer rate M ̇ of the order of 10−8 M ⊙ yr−1, for a white-dwarf mass of M wd ≈ 0.7 ± 0.2M ⊙, an inclination of i ∼ 60°, and a Gaia distance of of 840 − 25 + 31 pc. The sharp absorption lines of metals cannot form in the disk and are likely forming in material above the disk (e.g., due stream disk overflow), in circumbinary material, and/or in material associated with the ejected shell from the 1891 nova explosion. The saturated hydrogen Lyα absorption feature is attributed to a large interstellar-medium hydrogen-column density of the order of 1021cm−2 toward T Aur, as corroborated by the value of its reddening E(B − V) = 0.42 ± 0.08.","astronomy"
"Giant planets around young stars serve as a clue to unveiling their formation history and orbital evolution. CI Tau is a 2 Myr-old classical T Tauri star hosting an eccentric hot Jupiter, CI Tau b. The standard formation scenario of a hot Jupiter predicts that planets formed further out and migrated inward. A high eccentricity of CI Tau b may be suggestive of high-e migration due to secular gravitational perturbations by an outer companion. Also, the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array 1.3 mm-continuum observations show that CI Tau has at least three annular gaps in which unseen planets may exist. We present high-contrast imaging around CI Tau taken from the Keck/NIRC2 L ′ -band filter and vortex coronagraph that allows us to search for an outer companion. We did not detect any outer companion around CI Tau from angular differential imaging (ADI) using two deep imaging data sets. The detection limits from ADI-reduced images rule out the existence of an outer companion beyond ∼30 au that can cause the Kozai–Lidov migration of CI Tau b. Our results suggest that CI Tau b may have experienced type II migration from ≲2 au in megayears. We also confirm that no planets with ≥2–4 M Jup are hidden in two outer gaps.","astronomy"
"The microlensing event OGLE-2017-BLG-1434 features a cold super-Earth planet that is 1 of 11 microlensing planets with a planet–host-star mass ratio of q &lt; 1 × 10−4. We provide an additional mass–distance constraint on the lens host using near-infrared adaptive optics photometry from Keck/NIRC2. We are able to determine a flux excess of K L = 16.96 ± 0.11, which most likely comes entirely from the lens star. Combining this with constraints from the large Einstein ring radius, θ E = 1.40 ± 0.09 mas, and OGLE parallax we confirm this event as a super-Earth with a mass of m p = 4.43 ± 0.25M ⊕. This system lies at a distance of D L = 0.86 ± 0.05 kpc from Earth and the lens star has a mass of M L = 0.234 ± 0.012M ⊙. We confirm that with a star–planet mass ratio of q = 0.57 × 10−4, OGLE-2017-BLG-1434 lies near the inflexion point of the planet–host mass-ratio power law.","astronomy"
"Starlight subtraction algorithms based on the method of Karhunen–Loève eigenimages have proved invaluable to exoplanet direct imaging. However, they scale poorly in runtime when paired with differential imaging techniques. In such observations, reference frames and frames from which starlight is to be subtracted are drawn from the same set of data, requiring a new subset of references (and eigenimages) for each frame processed to avoid self-subtraction of the signal of interest. The data rates of extreme adaptive optics instruments are such that the only way to make this computationally feasible has been to downsample the data. We develop a technique that updates a precomputed singular value decomposition of the full data set to remove frames (i.e., a “downdate”) without a full recomputation, yielding the modified eigenimages. This not only enables analysis of much larger data volumes in the same amount of time, but also exhibits near-linear scaling in runtime as the number of observations increases. We apply this technique to archival data and investigate its scaling behavior for very large numbers of frames N. The resulting algorithm provides speed improvements of 2.6× (for 200 eigenimages at N = 300) to 140× (at N = 104) with the advantage only increasing as N grows. This algorithm has allowed us to substantially accelerate Karhunen–Loève image projection (KLIP) even for modest N, and will let us quickly explore how KLIP parameters affect exoplanet characterization in large-N data sets.","astronomy"
"Using archival near-IR photometry, we identify 51 of the K-band brightest red supergiants (RSGs) in NGC 6822 and compare their physical properties with stellar evolutionary model predictions. We first use Gaia parallax and proper motion values to filter out foreground Galactic red dwarfs before constructing a J–K versus K color–magnitude diagram to eliminate lower-mass asymptotic giant branch star contaminants in NGC 6822. We then cross match our results to previously spectroscopically confirmed RSGs and other NGC 6822 content studies and discuss our overall completeness, concluding that radial velocity alone is an insufficient method of determining membership in NGC 6822. After transforming the J and K magnitudes to effective temperatures and luminosities, we compare these physical properties with predictions from both the Geneva single-star and Binary Population and Spectral Synthesis (BPASS) single and binary-star evolution tracks. We find that our derived temperatures and luminosities match the evolutionary model predictions well, however, the BPASS model, which includes the effects of binary evolution, provides the best overall fit. This revealed the presence of a group of cool RSGs in NGC 6822, suggesting a history of binary interaction. We hope this work will lead to further comparative RSG studies in other Local Group galaxies, opportunities for direct spectroscopic follow-up, and a better understanding of evolutionary model predictions.","astronomy"
"We report on the discovery of a transiting Earth-sized (0.95R ⊕) planet around an M3.5 dwarf star at 57 pc, EPIC 249631677. The planet has a period of ∼3.14 days, i.e., ∼π, with an installation of 7.45 S⊕. The detection was made using publicly available data from K2's Campaign 15. We observed three additional transits with SPECULOOS Southern and Northern Observatories, and a stellar spectrum from Keck/HIRES, which allowed us to validate the planetary nature of the signal. The confirmed planet is well suited for comparative terrestrial exoplanetology. While exoplanets transiting ultracool dwarfs present the best opportunity for atmospheric studies of terrestrial exoplanets with the James Webb Space Telescope, those orbiting mid-M dwarfs within 100 pc such as EPIC 249631677b will become increasingly accessible with the next generation of observatories.","astronomy"
"A growing group of stellar triple systems contains an eclipsing binary for which the depth of eclipses has been proven to change in time, a sign of evolving orbital inclination. The recent analysis of historical observations of HS Hya significantly extended the timespan over which the inclination changes are known for this system. Here we add a few more observations and reanalyze the whole data set with a single methodology. We also improve our own analytical approach to enable describing the secular evolution of the orbital architecture of hierarchical triple systems applicable to the HS Hya case. Analyzing the available photometric and spectroscopic data we obtain two main results. First, the dynamical evolution itself allows to constrain the masses of the stars in the inner binary to 1.31 ± 0.03 M ⊙ and 1.27 ± 0.03 M ⊙, and the mass of the unseen third component to 0.56 − 0.09 + 0.12 M ⊙ (all 95% confidence level results). This makes it an M- or K-type dwarf accompanying the binary. Second, the orbital planes of the inner binary and the third component are significantly noncoplanar, allowing two solutions for their mutual angle J. Either the motion of the third component is prograde, and J is most likely in the 50°–65° range, or the motion is retrograde, and J is most likely in the 120°–150° range. The precession period of both orbital planes about the total angular angular momentum is ∼700 yr (with about two centuries of uncertainty). This implies HS Hya will become eclipsing again around the year 2200.","astronomy"
"Sensitive signal processing methods are needed to detect transiting planets from ground-based photometric surveys. Caceres et al. show that the autoregressive planet search (ARPS) method—a combination of autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) parametric modeling, a new transit comb filter (TCF) periodogram, and machine learning classification—is effective when applied to evenly spaced light curves from space-based missions. We investigate here whether ARIMA and TCF will be effective for ground-based survey light curves that are often sparsely sampled with high noise levels from atmospheric and instrumental conditions. The ARPS procedure is applied to selected light curves with strong planetary signals from the Kepler mission that have been altered to simulate the conditions of ground-based exoplanet surveys. Typical irregular cadence patterns are used from the Hungarian-made Automated Telescope Network-South (HATSouth) survey. We also evaluate recovery of known planets from HATSouth. Simulations test transit signal recovery as a function of cadence pattern and duration, stellar magnitude, planet orbital period, and transit depth. Detection rates improve for shorter periods and deeper transits. The study predicts that the ARPS methodology will detect planets with ≳0.1% transit depth and periods ≲40 days in HATSouth stars brighter than ∼15 mag. ARPS methodology is therefore promising for planet discovery from ground-based exoplanet surveys with sufficiently dense cadence patterns.","astronomy"
"We continue our program of publishing all planets (and possible planets) found by eye in 2021 Korea Microlensing Telescope Network (KMTNet) online data. We present four planets (KMT-2021-BLG-0712Lb, KMT-2021-BLG-0909Lb, KMT-2021-BLG-2478Lb, and KMT-2021-BLG-1105Lb), with planet-to-host mass ratios in the range − 3.3 ≲ log q ≲ − 2.2 . This brings the total of secure, by-eye, 2021 KMTNet planets to 16, including 8 in this series. The by-eye sample is an important check of the completeness of semiautomated detections, which are the basis for statistical analyses. One of the planets, KMT-2021-BLG-1105Lb, is blended with a relatively bright (I, V) ∼ (18.9, 21.6) star that may be the host. This could be verified immediately by high-resolution imaging. If so, the host is an early G dwarf, and the planet could be characterized by radial velocity observations on 30 m class telescopes.","astronomy"
"HIP 45734 is a quadruple system of 2 + 2 architecture located at 68 pc from the Sun. The outer 9″ system A,B has a period of ∼104 yr. The subsystem Aa,Ab is a visual binary with a period of 20.1 yr and an eccentricity of 0.78. Its periastron in 2019.1 was observed spectroscopically, yielding masses (1.10 ± 0.04 and 0.98 ± 0.03 ) and orbital parallax, 14.90 ± 0.37 mas. The masses, luminosities, and colors approximately agree with evolutionary models of main-sequence stars. Component Aa has a detectable lithium line, whereas in Ab it is absent. The pair Ba,Bb is a single-lined spectroscopic binary with a period of 0.55552 day and an orbital inclination of ∼45° derived by modeling the rotationally broadened line profile with flat bottom. The mass of Bb is ∼0.4 . Star B is chromospherically active (an X-ray source); its flux is modulated with the orbital period by starspots, in addition to occasional flares. The system is probably older than ∼600 Myr; it does not belong to any known moving group.","astronomy"
"The analysis of multiple populations (MPs) in globular clusters (GCs), both spectroscopically and photometrically, is key in understanding their formation and evolution. The relatively narrow Johnson U, F336W, and Stromgren and Sloan u filters have been crucial in exhibiting these MPs photometrically, but in Paper I we showed that the broader Washington C filter can more efficiently detect MPs in the test case GC NGC 1851. Additionally, In Paper I we detected a double main sequence (MS) that has not been detected in previous observations of NGC 1851. We now match this photometry to NGC 1851's published RGB abundances and find that the two RGB branches observed in C generally exhibit different abundance characteristics in a variety of elements (e.g., Ba, Na, and O) and in CN band strengths, but no single element can define the two RGB branches. However, simultaneously considering [Ba/Fe] or CN strength with either [Na/Fe], [O/Fe], or CN strength can separate the two photometric RGB branches into two distinct abundance groups. Matches of NGC 1851's published SGB and HB abundances to the Washington photometry shows consistent characterizations of the MPs, which can be defined as an O-rich/N-normal population and an O-poor/N-rich population. Photometric synthesis for both the Washington C filter and the F336W filter finds that these abundance characteristics, with appropriate variations in He, can reproduce for both filters the photometric observations in both the RGB and the MS. This photometric synthesis also confirms the throughput advantages that the C filter has in detecting MPs.","astronomy"
"We present new SDSS and Washington photometry of the young outer-halo stellar system Segue 3. Combined with archival VI-observations, our most consistent results yield , , , and , with a high binary fraction of 0.39 ± 0.05 derived using the Padova models. We confirm that mass-segregation has occurred, supporting the hypothesis that this cluster is being tidally disrupted. A three-parameter King model yields a cluster radius of , a core radius of , and a tidal radius of . A comparison of Padova and Dartmouth model-grids indicates that the cluster is not significantly α-enhanced, with a mean dex, and a population age of only 2.6 ± 0.4 Gyr. We rule out a statistically significant age spread at the main-sequence turnoff because of a narrow subgiant branch, and discuss the role of stellar rotation and cluster age, using Dartmouth and Geneva models: approximately 70% of the Seg 3 stars at or below the main-sequence turnoff have enhanced rotation. Our results for Segue 3 indicate that it is younger and more metal-rich than all previous studies have reported to date. From colors involving Washington C and SDSS-u filters, we identify several giants and a possible blue straggler for future follow-up spectroscopic studies, and we produce spectral energy distributions of previously known members and potential Segue 3 sources with Washington (CT 1), Sloan (ugri), and VI-filters. Segue 3 shares the characteristics of unusual stellar systems that have likely been stripped from external dwarf galaxies as they are being accreted by the Milky Way, or that have been formed during such an event. Its youth, metallicity, and location are all inconsistent with Segue 3 being a cluster native to the Milky Way.","astronomy"
"Rocky exoplanets are expected to be eroded by space weather in a similar way as in the solar system. In particular, Mercury is one of the dramatically eroded planets whose material continuously escapes into its exosphere and further into space. This escape is well traced by sodium atoms scattering sunlight. Due to solar wind impact, micrometeorite impacts, photo-stimulated desorption and thermal desorption, sodium atoms are released from surface regolith. Some of these released sodium atoms are escaping from Mercury’s gravitational-sphere. They are dragged anti-Sun-ward and form a tail structure. We expect similar phenomena on exoplanets. The hot super-Earth 61 Vir b orbiting a G3V star at only 0.05 au may show a similar structure. Because of its small separation from the star, the sodium release mechanisms may be working more efficiently on hot super-Earths than on Mercury, although the strong gravitational force of Earth-sized or even more massive planets may be keeping sodium atoms from escaping from the planet. Here, we performed model simulations for Mercury (to verify our model) and 61 Vir b as a representative super-Earth. We have found that sodium atoms can escape from this exoplanet due to stellar wind sputtering and micrometeorite impacts, to form a sodium tail. However, in contrast to Mercury, the tail on this hot super-Earth is strongly aligned with the anti-starward direction because of higher light pressure. Our model suggests that 61 Vir b seems to have an exo-base atmosphere like that of Mercury.","astronomy"
"Stellar atmospheric parameters (effective temperature, surface gravity, and metallicity) are fundamental for understanding the formation and evolution of stars and galaxies. Photometric data can provide a low-cost way to estimate these parameters, but traditional methods based on photometric magnitudes have many limitations. In this paper, we propose a novel model called Bayesian Convit, which combines an approximate Bayesian framework with a deep-learning method, namely Convit, to derive stellar atmospheric parameters from Sloan Digital Sky Survey images of stars and effectively provide corresponding confidence levels for all the predictions. We achieve high accuracy for T eff and [Fe/H], with σ(T eff) = 172.37 K and σ([Fe/H]) = 0.23 dex. For log g , which is more challenging to estimate from image data, we propose a two-stage approach: (1) classify stars into two categories based on their log g values (&gt;4 dex or &lt;4 dex) and (2) regress separately these two subsets. We improve the estimation accuracy of stars with log g &gt; 4 dex significantly to σ ( log g &gt; 4 ) = 0.052 dex, which are comparable to those based on spectral data. The final joint result is σ ( log g ) = 0.41 dex. Our method can be applied to large photometric surveys like Chinese Space Station Telescope and Large Synoptic Survey Telescope.","astronomy"
"We present Fabry–Pérot (FP) imaging and longslit spectroscopy of the nearby Seyfert II galaxy NGC 1068 using the Robert Stobie Spectrograph (RSS) on the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT) to observe the impact of the central active galactic nucleus (AGN) on the ionized gas in the galaxy on kiloparsec scales. With SALT RSS FP we are able to observe the Hα + [N ii] emission line complex over a ∼2.6 arcmin2 field of view. Combined with the longslit observation, we demonstrate the efficacy of FP spectroscopy for studying nearby Type II Seyfert galaxies and investigate the kiloparsec-scale ionized gas in NGC 1068. We confirm the results of previous work from the TYPHOON/Progressive Integral Step Method survey that the kiloparsec-scale ionized features in NGC 1068 are driven by AGN photoionization. We analyze the spatial variation of the AGN intensity to put forward an explanation for the shape and structure of the kiloparsec-scale ionization features. Using a toy model, we suggest the ionization features may be understood as a light echo from a burst of enhanced AGN activity ∼2000 yr ago.","astronomy"
"C-band Mueller matrices for the Green Bank Telescope are presented here which enable on-sky Stokes parameters for point sources at the beam center to be determined. Standard calibrators, 3C 138 and 3C 286, were observed using the Spider program to steer the telescope across a broad range of R.A. on both sides of the zenith transit. For this analysis, only the observations at the peak of the Spider pattern were used rather than the full sweep of the runs. Therefore, the results presented here only apply to point sources at the beam center. The Mueller matrices are shown to vary with frequency and with use of the Hi-Cal or Lo-Cal noise diodes, due to the relative calibration gain between the X and Y components of the feed. However, the relative calibration gain can be determined from observations of a source with known polarization. Correcting the data for the relative calibration gain prior to data analysis allows for use of a frequency-independent Mueller matrix. This generic Mueller matrix is shown to provide reliable C-band polarization measurements.","astronomy"
"We report on observations of the extended environment of the bright Be star γ-Cas performed using intensity interferometry measurements within its Hα emission line. These observations were performed using a modified version of the I2C intensity interferometry instrument installed onto the 1.54 m MéO optical metrology telescope and a portable 1 m telescope (T1M). In order to better constrain the extent of the H α envelope, observations were performed for two different positions of the T1M telescope, corresponding to an intermediate and long baselines in which the extended region was partially and fully resolved. We find that the observed data are consistent with past interferometric observations of γ-Cas. These observations demonstrate the capability to equip optical telescopes of different optical designs with intensity interferometry capabilities and illustrate the potential to scale a similar system onto many additional telescopes.","astronomy"
"Millimeter emission from debris disks around stars of different ages provides constraints on the collisional evolution of planetesimals. We present ALMA 1.3 millimeter observations of a sample of 76 Solar-type stars in the ∼115 Myr old Pleiades star cluster. These ALMA observations complement previous infrared observations of this sample by providing sensitivity to emission from circumstellar dust at lower temperatures, corresponding to debris at radii comparable to the Kuiper Belt and beyond. The observations obtain a beam size of 1.″5 (200 au) and a median rms noise of 54 μJy beam−1, which corresponds to a fractional luminosity L dust/L star ∼ 10−4 for 40 K dust for a typical star in the sample. The ALMA images show no significant detections of the targeted stars. We interpret these limits in the context of a steady-state collisional cascade model for debris disk evolution that provides a good description of observations of the field population near the Sun but is not well-calibrated on younger populations. The ALMA nondetections of the Pleiades systems are compatible with the disk flux predictions of this model. We find no high fractional luminosity outliers from these ALMA data that could be associated with enhanced collisions resulting from activity not accounted for by steady-state evolution. However, we note that two systems (H ii 1132 and HD 22680) show 24 μm excess much higher than the predictions of this model, perhaps due to unusually high dust production from dynamical events involving planets.","astronomy"
"Solar coronal mass ejections (CMEs) have a strong association with solar flares that is not fully understood. This characteristic of our Sun’s magnetic activity may also occur on other stars, but the lack of successfully detected stellar CMEs makes it difficult to perform statistical studies that might show a similar association between CMEs and flares. Because of the potentially strong association, the search for stellar CMEs often starts with a successful search for superflares on magnetically active stars. Regardless of the flare’s presence, we emphasize the utility of searching for CME-specific spectroscopic signatures when attempting to find and confirm stellar CME candidates. We use solar CMEs as examples of why a multitude of ultraviolet emission lines, when detected simultaneously, can substantially improve the credibility of spectroscopically discovered stellar CME candidates. We make predictions on how bright CME-related emission lines can be if they are derived from distant stars. We recommend the use of three emission lines in particular (C iv 1550 Å, O vi 1032 Å, and C iii 977 Å) due to their potentially bright signal and convenient diagnostic capabilities that can be used to confirm if an observational signature truly derives from a stellar CME.","astronomy"
"The hydroxyl (OH) radical produced by photodissociation of water molecule is one of the most important indicators for cometary outgassing activity. The absorption lines of the OH radical at 1665 and 1667 MHz in the coma of comet C/2013 US10 Catalina were detected between 2015 December 3 and 5 by the Tian Ma Radio Telescope of Shanghai Astronomical Observatory. The source flux intensity was derived to be about −209 mJy km s−1 and −86 mJy km s−1 at 1665 MHz and 1667 MHz, respectively. The corresponding gas production rate was estimated to be (8.78 ± 1.47) × 1028 H2O s−1 and (5.94 ± 1.27) × 1028 H2O s−1, accordingly.","astronomy"
"Transiting compact multiplanet systems provide many unique opportunities to characterize the planets, including studies of size distributions, mean densities, orbital dynamics, and atmospheric compositions. The relatively short orbital periods in these systems ensure that events requiring specific orbital locations of the planets (such as primary transit and secondary eclipse points) occur with high frequency. The orbital motion and associated phase variations of the planets provide a means to constrain the atmospheric compositions through measurement of their albedos. Here we describe the expected phase variations of the TRAPPIST-1 system and times of superior conjunction when the summation of phase effects produce maximum amplitudes. We also describe the infrared flux emitted by the TRAPPIST-1 planets and the influence on the overall phase amplitudes. We further present the results from using the global circulation model ROCKE-3D to model the atmospheres of TRAPPIST-1e and TRAPPIST-1f assuming modern Earth and Archean atmospheric compositions. These simulations are used to calculate predicted phase curves for both reflected light and thermal emission components. We discuss the detectability of these signatures and the future prospects for similar studies of phase variations for relatively faint M stars.","astronomy"
"Based on spectroscopic observations for the eclipsing binaries CSTAR 036162 and CSTAR 055495 with the WiFeS/2.3 m telescope at SSO and CSTAR 057775 with the Mage/Magellan I at LCO in 2017, stellar parameters are derived. More than 100 nights of almost-continuous light curves reduced from the time-series photometric observations by CSTAR at Dome A of Antarctic in i in 2008 and in g and r in 2009, respectively, are applied to find photometric solutions for the three binaries with the Wilson–Devinney code. The results show that CSTAR 036162 is a detached configuration with the mass ratio q = 0.354 ± 0.0009, while CSTAR 055495 is a semi-detached binary system with the unusual q = 0.946 ± 0.0006, which indicates that CSTAR 055495 may be a rare binary system with mass ratio close to one and the secondary component filling its Roche Lobe. This implies that a mass-ratio reversal has just occurred and CSTAR 055495 is in a rapid mass-transfer stage. Finally, CSTAR 057775 is believed to be an A-type W UMa binary with q = 0.301 ± 0.0008 and a fill-out factor of f = 0.742(8).","astronomy"
"In the search for life beyond our solar system, attention should be focused on those planets that have the potential to maintain habitable conditions over the prolonged periods of time needed for the emergence and expansion of life as we know it. The observable planetary architecture is one of the determinants for long-term habitability as it controls the orbital evolution and ultimately the stellar fluxes received by the planet. With an ensemble of n-body simulations and obliquity models of hypothetical planetary systems, we demonstrate that the amplitude and period of the eccentricity, obliquity, and precession cycles of an Earth-like planet are sensitive to the orbital characteristics of a giant companion planet. A series of transient, ocean-coupled climate simulations show how these characteristics of astronomical cycles are decisive for the evolving surface conditions and long-term fractional habitability relative to the modern Earth. The habitability of Earth-like planets increases with the eccentricity of a Jupiter-like companion, provided that the mean obliquity is sufficiently low to maintain temperate temperatures over large parts of its surface throughout the orbital year. A giant companion closer in results in shorter eccentricity cycles of an Earth-like planet but longer, high-amplitude, obliquity cycles. The period and amplitude of obliquity cycles can be estimated to first order from the orbital pathways calculated by the n-body simulations. In the majority of simulations, the obliquity amplitude relates directly to the orbital inclination whereas the period of the obliquity cycle is a function of the nodal precession and the proximity of the giant companion.","astronomy"
"We have discovered a potential T0 ± 1 subdwarf from a search for sources in the AllWISE2 Motion Survey that do not have counterparts in surveys at shorter wavelengths. With a tangential velocity of ∼170 km s−1, this object—WISE J071121.36–573634.2—has kinematics that are consistent with the thick-disk population of the Milky Way. Spectral fits suggest a low-metallicity for this object but also allow for the possibility of unresolved multiplicity. If WISE J0711–5736 is indeed an sdT0 dwarf, it would be only the second early-T subdwarf discovered to date.","astronomy"
"In this paper we note that extragalactic sources seem to have non-zero proper motions in the PPMXL proper motion catalog. We collect a large, all sky sample of extragalactic objects and fit their reported PPMXL proper motions to an ensemble of spherical harmonics in magnitude shells. A magnitude-dependent proper motion correction is thus constructed. This correction is applied to a set of fundamental radio sources, quasars, and is compared to similar corrections to assess its utility. We publish, along with this paper, a code that can be used to correct proper motions in the PPMXL catalog over the full sky; this code requires Two Micron All Sky Survey photometry.","astronomy"
"We model the observed precision differential abundance patterns of three G-type dwarfs, assuming a mass of planetary or disk material was added to or subtracted from the atmosphere of the star. The two-parameter model is fit by linear regression. The stellar abundance patterns are corrected for Galactic chemical evolution (GCE). The differential abundances can be highly correlated with the elemental condensation temperature. We show how it is possible to match not only the slope, but the quantitative abundance differences, assuming a composition for the added material equal to that of the bulk earth. We also model the wide pair HIP 34407 and HIP 34426, where GCE corrections are assumed unnecessary. An appendix discusses issues of volatility and condensation temperature.","astronomy"
"With every new discovery of an extrasolar planet, the absence of planets in globular clusters (GCs) becomes more and more conspicuous. Null detection of transiting hot Jupiters in GCs 47 Tuc, ω Cen, and NGC 6397 presents an important puzzle, raising questions about the role played by cluster metallicity and environment on formation and survival of planetary systems in densely populated stellar clusters. GCs were postulated to have many free-floating planets, for which microlensing (ML) is an established tool for detection. Dense environments, well-constrained distances and kinematics of lenses and sources, and photometry of thousands of stars simultaneously make GCs the ideal targets to search for ML. We present first results of a multisite, 69-night-long campaign to search for ML signatures of low-mass objects in the GC M4, which was chosen because of its proximity, location, and the actual existence of a planet. M4 was observed in R and I bands by two telescopes, 1 m T40 and 18-inch C18, of the Wise Observatory, Tel Aviv, Israel, from 2011 April to July. Observations on the 1 m telescope were carried out in service mode, gathering 12 to 48 20 s exposures per night for a total of 69 nights. C18 observations were done for about 4 hr a night for six nights in 2011 May. We employ a semiautomated pipeline to calibrate and reduce the images to the light curves that our group is developing for this purpose, which includes the differential photometry package DIAPL, written by Wozniak and modified by W. Pych. Several different diagnostics are employed for search of variability/transients. While no high-significance ML event was found in this observational run, we have detected more than 20 new variables and variable candidates in the M4 field, which we present here.","astronomy"
"We present an analysis of X-ray observations made with ASCA and XMM-Newton of the Galactic supernova remnant (SNR) G311.5?0.3. Prior infrared and radio observations of this SNR have revealed a shell-like morphology at both wavelengths. The spectral index of the radio emission is consistent with synchrotron emission, while the infrared colors are consistent with emission from shocked molecular hydrogen. Also previous CO observations have indicated an interaction between G311.5?0.3 and an adjacent molecular cloud. Our previous analysis of the pointed ASCA observation made of this SNR detected X-ray emission from the source for the first time but lacked the sensitivity and the angular resolution to rigorously investigate its X-ray properties. We have analyzed an archival XMM-Newton observation that included G311.5?0.3 in the field of view: this is the first time that XMM-Newton data has been used to probe the X-ray properties of this SNR. The XMM-Newton observation confirms that the X-ray emission from G311.5?0.3 is centrally concentrated and supports the classification of this source as a mixed-morphology SNR. In addition, our joint fitting of extracted ASCA and XMM-Newton spectra favor a thermal origin for the X-ray emission over a non-thermal origin. The spectral fitting parameters for our TBABS?APEC fit to the extracted spectra are NH = 4.63+1.87 ?0.85?1022 cm ?2 and kT = 0.68+0.20?0.24 keV. From these fit parameters, we derive the following values for physical parameters of the SNR: ne = 0.20 cm ?3, np = 0.17 cm ?3, MX = 21.4 M? and P/k = 3.18?106 K cm ?3.","astronomy"

"Future direct imaging mission concepts are planning to observe planets discovered via Doppler spectroscopy, with observation scheduling decisions based on radial velocity (RV) fit orbits to increase the mission’s odds of making a detection. However, some orbital parameters, such as inclination and planet radius, that are necessary to determine when a planet is detectable via imaging cannot be resolved with only RV data. This work studies how to best use a RV fit to determine when a planet will be detectable with direct imaging and quantify the impacts of RV-measurement precision on direct imaging observations. Beginning by defining a “true” planet, we simulate RV observations, fit the RV observations via Bayesian orbit fitting, construct many Keplerian orbits based on the RV fit and priors on the unknown orbital parameters, and propagate the constructed orbits and the true orbit for 20 yr to determine when the constructed orbits deviate significantly. We identify four methods of constructing orbits, ultimately finding that creating and sampling high-likelihood orbital parameters from a multivariate Gaussian produces the best results for high RV error and that creating and sampling from a simple normal distribution for each orbital parameter independently performs the best for low RV error. Further, we establish two modes of failure: intermittent failure, which captures when the constructed orbits incorrectly indicate that a planet is detectable; and dispersion failure, when the constructed orbits have dispersed so much that they no longer provide useful information.","astronomy"
"We present a statistical analysis of the local, ≈50–100 pc scale, Hα emission at the locations of recent (≤125 yr) supernovae (SNe) in nearby star-forming galaxies. Our sample consists of 32 SNe in 10 galaxies that are targets of the PHANGS-MUSE survey. We find that 41% (13/32) of these SNe occur coincident with a previously identified H ii region. For comparison, H ii regions cover 32% of the area within ±1 kpc of any recent SN. Contrasting this local covering fraction with the fraction of SNe coincident with H ii regions, we find a statistical excess of 7.6% ± 8.7% of all SNe to be associated with H ii regions. This increases to an excess of 19.2% ± 10.4% when considering only core-collapse SNe (CCSNe). These estimates appear to be in good agreement with qualitative results from new, higher-resolution Hubble Space Telescope Hα imaging, which also suggests many CCSNe detonate near but not in H ii regions. Our results appear consistent with the expectation that only a modest fraction of stars explode during the first ≲5 Myr of the life of a stellar population when Hα emission is expected to be bright. Of the H ii region associated SNe, 85% (11/13) also have associated detected CO (2–1) emission, indicating the presence of molecular gas. The SNe associated with H ii regions have typical extinctions of A V ∼ 1 mag, consistent with a significant amount of pre-clearing of gas from the region before the SNe explode.","astronomy"
"For simple electromagnetic models of a rod and a clock, a change of shape of a rod and of the rate of clock when they are set in uniform motion is calculated exactly, employing the correct equation of motion of a charged particle in electromagnetic field and the universal boostability assumption. Thus it is demonstrated that, for the simple system considered, the length contraction and clock retardation can be interpreted as dynamical cause-and-effect phenomena, and not as kinematical effects as usually construed in conventional presentations of Special Relativity. It is argued that the perspective relativistic change of an object (corresponding to observations from two inertial frames), while certainly being an a causal effect, has a dynamical content in the sense that it is tantamount to an actual dynamical change of the object in one frame.","astronomy"
"The Jansky Very Large Array was used to observe 121 magnetic cataclysmic variables (MCVs). We report radio detections of 18 stars. Thirteen are new radio sources, increasing the number of MCVs that are radio sources by more than twofold, from 8 to 21. Most detections are at 8.7 GHz (X-band) with a lesser number at 5.4 and 21.1 GHz (C- and K-bands). With the exception of AE Aqr, whose flux density is typically &gt;5 mJy, the flux densities are in the range of 24–780 μJy. Thirteen of the detections show highly circularly polarized emission, which is characteristic of electron-cyclotron maser emission. The data suggest that MCVs could possibly be divided into two classes of radio emitters: those dominated by weakly polarized gyrosynchrotron emission and those by highly polarized electron-cyclotron maser emission.","astronomy"
"A new 1.4 GHz, 19-element, dual-polarization, cryogenic phased-array feed (PAF) radio astronomy receiver has been developed for the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope (GBT) as part of the Focal L-band Array for the GBT (FLAG) project. Commissioning observations of calibrator radio sources show that this receiver has the lowest reported beam-formed system temperature (T sys) normalized by aperture efficiency (η) of any phased-array receiver to date. The measured T sys/η is 25.4 ± 2.5 K near 1350 MHz for the boresight beam, which is comparable to the performance of the current 1.4 GHz cryogenic single-feed receiver on the GBT. The degradation in T sys/η at ∼4′ (required for Nyquist sampling) and ∼8′ offsets from the boresight is, respectively, ∼1% and ∼20% of the boresight value. The survey speed of the PAF with seven formed beams is larger by a factor between 2.1 and 7 compared to a single-beam system, depending on the observing application. The measured performance, both in frequency and offset from the boresight, qualitatively agrees with predictions from a rigorous electromagnetic model of the PAF. The astronomical utility of the receiver is demonstrated by observations of the pulsar B0329+54 and an extended H ii region, the Rosette Nebula. The enhanced survey speed with the new PAF receiver will enable the GBT to carry out exciting new science, such as more efficient observations of diffuse, extended neutral hydrogen emission from galactic inflows and searches for fast radio bursts.","astronomy"
"We present a Bayesian method to cross-match 5,827,988 high proper-motion Gaia sources (μ &gt; 40 mas yr−1) to various photometric surveys: Two Micron All Sky Survey, AllWISE data release from the Wide-field Infrared Explorer (WISE) mission, Galaxy Evolution Explorer, Radial Velocity Experiment, Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS). To efficiently associate these objects across catalogs, we develop a technique that compares the multidimensional distribution of all sources in the vicinity of each Gaia star to a reference distribution of random field stars obtained by extracting all sources in a region on the sky displaced 2′. This offset preserves the local field stellar density and magnitude distribution, allowing us to characterize the frequency of chance alignments. The resulting catalog with Bayesian probabilities &gt;95% has a marginally higher match rate than current internal Gaia data release 2 (DR2) matches for most catalogs. However, a significant improvement is found with Pan-STARRS, where ∼99.8% of the sample within the Pan-STARRS footprint is recovered, as compared to a low ∼20.8% in Gaia DR2. Using these results, we train a Gaussian process regressor to calibrate two photometric metallicity relationships. For dwarfs of 3500 &lt; T eff &lt; 5280 K, we use metallicity values of 4378 stars from the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment and Hejazi et al. to calibrate the relationship, producing results with a 1σ precision of 0.12 dex and few systematic errors. We then indirectly infer the metallicity of 4018 stars with 2850 &lt; T eff &lt; 3500 K, which are wide companions of primaries whose metallicities are estimated with our first regressor, to produce a relationship with a 1σ precision of 0.21 dex and significant systematic errors. Additional work is needed to better remove unresolved binaries from this second sample to reduce these systematic errors.","astronomy"
"It was confirmed that there is a strong linear correlation between the thermal far-infrared (FIR) and non-thermal radio emission of the star-forming galaxies. Recent works based on this correlation over large redshifts have shown that the correlation is evolving towards higher redshifts. In this paper, possible physical causes that lead to the evolution of this correlation are explored. One possible cause is that the interaction between galaxies is responsible for this behavior. We used the morphology of galaxies, as an indicator of past or present interactions, because it is generally known that the irregular morphology of galaxies is a consequence of collisions or close approaches. To test this hypothesis, a sample of dusty star-forming galaxies up to a redshift z = 3:5 from the COSMOS field has been selected. The sample has been divided, according to the morphological type, into two subsamples (disk and irregular galaxies), and the evolution of the correlation with redshift has been analyzed separately for both of them. It was found that in both subsamples there is no indication for the redshift evolution of the FIR-radio correlation. However, it was also found that the mean correlation parameter, qFIR, is lower in irregular galaxies, which may indicate that they can still affect the evolution of the correlation if their abundance in the sample increases towards higher redshifts. Disk galaxies, which statistically dominate the sample, may be responsible for the lack of this evolution. On the other hand, a fundamental problem with optically determined morphology is the dust obscuration in massive galaxies at z &gt; 2. To test the idea that interacting galaxies are responsible for redshift evolution of the FIR-radio correlation, it is, necessary to analyze a much larger sample for which the morphology has been determined, taking into account the VLA and ALMA imaging in addition to optical images, and which contains a higher fraction of irregular galaxies. Finally, it was also found that the qFIR parameter and its evolution are very sensitive to the radio spectral index above z &gt; 1 and that its misinterpretation and taking a constant value of ? = 0:7 may be responsible for the observed evolution of the correlation.","astronomy"
"We investigated the physical properties of molecular clouds and star formation (SF) processes around infrared bubbles, which are essentially expanding H ii regions. We performed observations of 13 galactic infrared bubble fields containing 18 bubbles. We observed five molecular lines—12CO ( ), 13CO ( ), C18O ( ), HCN ( ), and HCO+ ( )—and several publicly available surveys were used for comparison: Galactic Legacy Infrared Mid-Plane Survey Extraordinaire, Multiband Imaging Photometer for Spitzer Galactic Plane Survey, APEX Telescope Large Area Survey of the Galaxy, Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey, Very Large Array (VLA) Galactic Plane Survey, Multi-Array Galactic Plane Imaging Survey, and NRAO VLA Sky Survey. We find that these bubbles are generally connected with molecular clouds, most of which are giant. Several bubble regions display velocity gradients and broad-shifted profiles, which could be due to the expansion of bubbles. The masses of molecular clouds within bubbles range from 100 to 19,000 M ⊙, and their dynamic ages are about 0.3–3.7 Myr, which takes into account the internal turbulence pressure of surrounding molecular clouds. Clumps are found in the vicinity of all 18 bubbles, and molecular clouds near four of these bubbles with larger angular sizes show shell-like morphologies, indicating that either collect-and-collapse or radiation-driven implosion processes may have occurred. Due to the contamination of adjacent molecular clouds, only six bubble regions are appropriate to search for outflows, and we find that four have outflow activities. Three bubbles display ultra-compact H ii regions at their borders, and one is probably responsible for its outflow. In total, only six bubbles show SF activities in the vicinity, and we suggest that SF processes might have been triggered.","astronomy"
"Detailed elemental abundance patterns of metal-poor ([Fe/H] ∼ −1 dex) stars in the Galactic bulge indicate that a number of them are consistent with globular cluster (GC) stars and may be former members of dissolved GCs. This would indicate that a few per cent of the Galactic bulge was built up from destruction and/or evaporation of GCs. Here, an attempt is made to identify such presumptive stripped stars originating from the massive, inner Galaxy GC NGC 6441 using its rich RR Lyrae variable star (RRL) population. We present radial velocities of 40 RRLs centered on the GC NGC 6441. All 13 of the RRLs observed within the cluster tidal radius have velocities consistent with cluster membership, with an average radial velocity of 24 ± 5 km s−1 and a star-to-star scatter of 11 km s−1. This includes two new RRLs that were previously not associated with the cluster. Eight RRLs with radial velocities consistent with cluster membership but up to three time the distance from the tidal radius are also reported. These potential extra-tidal RRLs also have exceptionally long periods, which is a curious characteristic of the NGC 6441 RRL population that hosts RRLs with periods longer than seen anywhere else in the Milky Way. As expected of stripped cluster stars, most are inline with the cluster’s orbit. Therefore, either the tidal radius of NGC 6441 is underestimated and/or we are seeing dissolving cluster stars stemming from NGC 6441 that are building up the old spheroidal bulge.","astronomy"
"We developed a tool that measures equivalent widths of various lines in low-resolution optical spectra, and it was applied to stellar spectra obtained as part of SDSS-V and LAMOST programs. These lines, such as Li i, which directly indicates stellar youth, or optical H i and Ca ii, which in emission indicate activity associated with stellar youth, are commonly seen in YSOs. We observe several notable differences in the properties of these lines between YSOs and the field stars. Using these data, we devise a set of criteria through which it is possible to confirm the youth of stars that have been observed by the ABYSS program, as well as to identify likely young stars that have serendipitously been observed by other programs. We examine the decrement of H lines seen in emission in CTTSs, and estimate the properties of the accretion stream that is responsible for the production of these lines. Finally, we examine the evolution of Li i as a function of age, and characterize the scatter in its abundance that appears to be intrinsic in young M dwarfs.","astronomy"
"Long-period comet C/2014 B1 (Schwartz) exhibits a remarkable optical appearance, like that of a discus or bi-convex lens viewed edgewise. Our measurements in the four years since discovery reveal a unique elongated dust coma whose orientation is stable with respect to the projected antisolar and orbital directions. With no tail and no trail, the limited influence of radiation pressure on the dust coma sets a lower limit to the effective particle size ≳100 μm, while the photometry reveals a peak coma scattering cross-section 2.7 × 104 km2 (geometric albedo 0.1 assumed). From the rate of brightening of the comet we infer a dust production rate ≳10 kg s−1 at 10 au heliocentric distance, presumably due to the sublimation of supervolatile ices, and perhaps triggered by the crystallization of amorphous water ice. We consider several models for the origin of the peculiar morphology. The disk-like shape is best explained by equatorial ejection of particles from a nucleus whose spin vector lies near the plane of the sky. In this interpretation, the unique appearance of C/2014 B1 is a result of a near equality between the rotation-assisted nucleus escape speed (∼1–10 m s−1 for a 2–20 km scale nucleus) and the particle ejection velocity, combined with a near-equatorial viewing perspective. To date, most other comets have been studied at heliocentric distances less than half that of C/2014 B1, where their nucleus temperatures, gas fluxes, and dust ejection speeds are much higher. The throttling role of nucleus gravity is correspondingly diminished, so that the disk morphology has not before been observed.","astronomy"
"We have identified a set of optical emission-line features 700″ (12 kpc) to the southwest of the nucleus of Centaurus A, roughly opposite to the radio jet and well-known optical emission filaments associated with the northern radio structure. This location is roughly along the axis of the southwestern radio lobes, although there is no coherent jet at this radius. We use integral-field optical spectroscopy to trace the ratios of strong emission lines, showing changes in excitation across the region, and significant local reddening. The emission regions are spatially associated with far-infrared emission peaks in one of two cold dust clouds identified using Herschel and Spitzer data, and there may be a mismatch between the low temperature of the dust and the expected heating effect of young stars. The strong emission lines have ratios consistent with photoionization in normal H ii regions, requiring only modest numbers of OB stars; these stars and their cooler accompanying populations must be largely obscured along our line of sight. These data fit with a picture of fairly ordinary formation of clusters in a large giant molecular cloud, or network of such clouds. The location, projected near the radio-source axis and within the radius where a starburst wind has been inferred on the other side of the galaxy, raises the question of whether this star-forming episode was enhanced or indeed triggered by an outflow from the central parts of Centaurus A. However, the level of star formation is normal for the associated cold-gas mass and column density, and optical emission-line ratios and line widths limit the role of shocks on the gas, so any interaction with an outflow, associated either with the radio source or star formation in the gas-rich disk of Centaurus A, can at most have compressed the gas weakly. We speculate that the presence of similar star-forming regions on both sides of the galaxy, contrasted with the difference in the character of the emission-line clouds, reflects the presence of a collimated radio jet to the northeast and perhaps anisotropic escape of ionizing radiation from the AGN as well. In this view, the star formation on the southwestern side of Cen A could be enhanced indirectly via compression by a broad outflow (whether originated by a starburst or AGN), distinct from the radio jet and lobes.","astronomy"
"We use astrometry of Pluto and other trans-neptunian objects to constrain the sky location, distance, and mass of the possible additional planet (Planet Nine) hypothesized by Batygin &amp; Brown. We find that over broad regions of the sky, the inclusion of a massive, distant planet degrades the fits to the observations. However, in other regions, the fits are significantly improved by the addition of such a planet. Our best fits suggest a planet that is either more massive or closer than argued for by Batygin &amp; Brown based on the orbital distribution of distant trans-neptunian objects (or by Fienga et al. based on range measured to the Cassini spacecraft). The trend to favor larger and closer perturbing planets is driven by the residuals to the astrometry of Pluto, remeasured from photographic plates using modern stellar catalogs, which show a clear trend in decl. over the course of two decades, that drive a preference for large perturbations. Although this trend may be the result of systematic errors of unknown origin in the observations, a possible resolution is that the decl. trend may be due to perturbations from a body, in addition to Planet Nine, that is closer to Pluto but less massive than Planet Nine.","astronomy"
"Proxima Centauri has become the subject of intense study since the radial-velocity (RV) discovery by Anglada-Escudé et al. of a planet orbiting this nearby M dwarf every ∼11.2 days. If Proxima Centauri b transits its host star, independent confirmation of its existence is possible, and its mass and radius can be measured in units of the stellar host mass and radius. To date, there have been three independent claims of possible transit-like event detections in light curve observations obtained by the MOST satellite (in 2014–15), the Bright Star Survey Telescope telescope in Antarctica (in 2016), and the Las Campanas Observatory (in 2016). The claimed possible detections are tentative, due in part to the variability intrinsic to the host star, and in the case of the ground-based observations, also due to the limited duration of the light curve observations. Here, we present preliminary results from an extensive photometric monitoring campaign of Proxima Centauri, using telescopes around the globe and spanning from 2006 to 2017, comprising a total of 329 observations. Considering our data that coincide directly and/or phased with the previously published tentative transit detections, we are unable to independently verify those claims. We do, however, verify the previously reported ubiquitous and complex variability of the host star. We discuss possible interpretations of the data in light of the previous claims, and we discuss future analyses of these data that could more definitively verify or refute the presence of transits associated with the RV-discovered planet.","astronomy"
"We present a study of two newly discovered heliocentric hyperbolic objects—2017 U7 and 2018 C2. Both are possibly thermally evolved comets. Observations of the latter in 2018 March from Xingming Observatory revealed that it has a color similar to those of the long-period comets, Trojans, and D-type asteroids: m B − m V = 0.75 ± 0.03, m V − m R = 0.41 ± 0.02, and m R − m I = 0.37 ± 0.03. A possible extremely faint coma of ∼9″ across was observed. The radial profile of 2018 C2 in comparison with those of the field stars helps confirm its cometary nature. Based on our convolution model, its mass-loss rate is estimated to be 0.7 ± 0.2 kg s−1. Assuming geometric albedo p R = 0.04, its effective radius is 4.4 ± 0.5 km, which means that the fraction of active area is merely ∼10−5–10−4. Our N-body dynamical simulations show that both objects are most likely dynamically old members from the Oort cloud. 2017 U7 has a ∼60% chance to escape the solar system in the 1.5 Myr following its current perihelion passage due to a moderate close encounter with Jupiter in 2020 May. On the condition that no disintegration occurs, 2018 C2 will revisit the inner solar system 0.13–0.14 Myr later, with perihelion distance ∼2 au.","astronomy"
"Multi-wavelength CCD photometry over 21 years has been used to produce deep color–magnitude diagrams (CMDs) together with light curves for the variables in the Galactic globular cluster NGC 5824. Twenty-one new cluster RR Lyrae stars are identified, bringing the total to 47, of which 42 have reliable periods determined for the first time. The CMD is matched using BaSTI isochrones with ages of 13 Gyr, and reddening is found to be using the period–Wesenheit relation in two colors, the distance modulus is corresponding to a distance of 30.9 Kpc. The observations show no signs of populations that are significantly younger than the 13 Gyr stars. The width of the red giant branch does not allow for a spread in greater than , and there is no photometric evidence for widened or parallel sequences. The pseudo-CMD shows a bifurcation of the red giant branch that by analogy with other clusters is interpreted as being due to differing spectral signatures of the first (75%) and second (25%) generations of stars whose age difference is close enough that main-sequence (MS) turnoffs in the CMD are unresolved. The cluster MS is visible against the background out to a radial distance of ∼17 arcmin. We conclude that NGC 5824 appears to be a classical Oosterhoff Type II globular cluster, without overt signs of being a remnant of a now-disrupted dwarf galaxy.","astronomy"
"The Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) is the nearest site of ongoing massive star formation, which allows us to study the kinematics and dynamics of the region in detail and constrain star formation theories. Using HST ACS/WFPC2/WFC3IR and Keck II NIRC2 data, we have measured the proper motions of 701 stars within an ∼6′ × 6′ field of view around the center of the ONC. We have found more than 10 escaping star candidates, concentrated predominantly at the core of the cluster. The proper motions of the bound stars are consistent with a normal distribution, albeit elongated north–south along the Orion filament, with proper-motion dispersions of mas yr−1 or intrinsic velocity dispersions of km s−1 assuming a distance of 400 pc to the ONC. The cluster shows no evidence for tangential-to-radial anisotropy. Our velocity dispersion profile agrees with the prediction from the observed stellar + gas density profile from Da Rio et al., indicating that the ONC is in virial equilibrium. This finding suggests that the cluster was formed with a low star formation efficiency per dynamical timescale based on comparisons with current star formation theories. Our survey also recovered high-velocity IR sources BN, x and n in the BN/KL region. The estimated location of the first two sources ∼500 yr ago agrees with that of the radio source I, consistent with their proposed common origin from a multistellar disintegration. However, source n appears to have a small proper motion and is unlikely to have been involved in the event.","astronomy"
"It is well known that most of the stars form in rich clusters. However, recent Spitzer observations have shown that a significant number of stars also form in the distributed mode; their origin is not well understood. In this work, we aim to investigate clustered and distributed modes of star formation in the W4 complex. To do so, we identified and characterized the young stellar population associated with the region using homogeneous infrared data sets obtained from the Two Micron All Sky Survey, GLIMPSE, MIPS, and Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer surveys. We make stellar surface density and minimum spanning tree maps to identify young clusters, and use Spitzer images to identify irradiated structures, such as elephant-trunk-like structures (ETLSs) and pillars in the region. The surface density distribution of the young stellar objects (YSOs) reveals three new clusterings and ∼50% distributed protostars in the H ii region. The clusters are of low-mass nature but significantly younger than the central cluster IC 1805. We identified ∼ 38 ETLSs in the region, a majority of which consist of one or a few stars at their tips. We find that these stars are low-mass (&lt;2 M ⊙) YSOs, located at the outskirts (&gt;17 pc) of the cluster IC 1805 and are part of the scattered distributed population. We argued that the star formation in the ETLSs of W4 is going on possibly due to the triggering effect of the expanding W4 bubble. Although high-resolution photometric and spectroscopic data would be required to confirm the scenario, nonetheless, we discuss the implications of this scenario for our understanding of distributed low-mass star formation in cloud complexes as opposed to other mechanisms such as turbulent fragmentation and dynamical ejection.","astronomy"
"We present the SCExAO direct imaging discovery and characterization of a low-mass companion to the nearby young A7IV star, HD 91312. SCExAO/CHARIS JHK (1.1–2.4 μm) spectra and SCExAO/HiCIAO H-band imaging identify the companion over a two year baseline in a highly inclined orbit with a maximum projected separation of 8 au. The companion, HD 91312 B, induces an 8.8σ astrometric acceleration on the star as seen with the Gaia &amp; Hipparcos satellites and a long-term radial-velocity trend as previously identified by Borgniet et al. HD 91312 B’s spectrum is consistent with that of an early-to-mid M dwarf. Hipparcos and Gaia absolute astrometry, radial-velocity data, and SCExAO/CHARIS astrometry constrain its dynamical mass to be 0.337 − 0.044 + 0.042 M ⊙, consistent with - but far more precise than - masses derived from spectroscopy, and favors a nearly edge-on orbit with a semimajor axis of ∼9.7 au. This work is an example of precisely characterizing properties of low-mass companions at solar system-like scales from a combination of direct imaging, astrometry, and radial-velocity methods.","astronomy"
"Modern astronomers enjoy access to all-sky images across a wide range of the electromagnetic spectrum from long-wavelength radio to high-energy gamma rays. The most prominent feature in many of these images is our own Galaxy, with different features revealed in each wave band. Gravitational waves (GWs) have recently been added to the astronomers’ toolkit as a nonelectromagnetic messenger. To date, all identified GW sources have been extra-Galactic and transient. However, the Milky Way hosts a population of ultracompact binaries (UCBs), which radiate persistent GWs in the milliHertz band that is not observable with today’s terrestrial gravitational-wave detectors. Space-based detectors such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna will measure this population and provide a census of their location, masses, and orbital properties. In this work, we will show how this data can be used to form a false-color image of the Galaxy that represents the intensity and frequency of the gravitational waves produced by the UCB population. Such images can be used to study the morphology of the Galaxy, identify interesting multimessenger sources through cross-matching, and for educational and outreach purposes.","astronomy"
"We present a near-infrared study of the Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 6300, based on subarcsecond images and long slit spectroscopy obtained with Flamingos-2 at Gemini South. We have found that the peak of the nuclear continuum emission in the K s band and the surrounding nuclear disk are 25 pc off-center with respect to the center of symmetry of the larger scale circumnuclear disk, suggesting that this black hole is still not fixed in the galaxy potential well. The molecular gas radial velocity curve yields a central black hole upper mass estimation of . The Paβ emission line has a strongly asymmetric profile with a blueshifted broad component that we associate with a nuclear ionized gas outflow. We have found in the K s -band spectra that the slope of the continuum becomes steeper with increasing radii, which can be explained as the presence of large amounts of hot dust not only in the nucleus but also in the circumnuclear region up to r = 27 pc. In fact, the nuclear red excess obtained after subtracting the stellar contribution resembles to that of a blackbody with temperatures around 1200 K. This evidence supports the idea that absorbing material located around the nucleus, but not close enough to be the torus of the unified model, could be responsible for at least part of the nuclear obscuration in this Seyfert 2 nucleus.","astronomy"

It is shown that out of 49 stars, only 7 (14%) has I type of spectrum distribution, the rest belong to type II. Fundamental parameters, including the mass and age of objects are determined. It is shown that the amount of excess radiation in the far IR range increases with age. The change in mass with age, in contrast to Herbig's AeBe stars, exhibits a complex character.","astronomy"
"We present a comparative analysis of observations of the selected exoplanet transits obtained at the Kyiv Comet station with the database of the TESS (Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite) and Kepler space telescopes. The light curves obtained by the TESS and Kepler orbital telescopes were processed using a program based on the Python package Lightcurve 2.3v which is freely available in the MUST archive (Barbara A. Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes). The ground based observations were carried out with the 70-cm telescope AZT- 8 (Lisnyky). Photometric processing of the ground based observation was performed by using the Muniwin program. The light curves and parameters of the observed transits as well as the exoplanet orbital parameters obtained from ground based observations were published in the ETD (Exoplanet Transit Database). Determined transit parameters were compared with the results of the TESS command, which are stored in the MUST archive. Here we presents a comparison of the parameters of transit phenomena (period, depth, transit duration) and some orbital parameters obtained from two independent sets of observations, terrestrial and orbital, performed in different epochs.","astronomy"
"Direct imaging of exoplanets presents a formidable technical challenge owing to the small angular separation and high contrast between exoplanets and their host stars. High Dispersion Coronagraphy (HDC) is a pathway to achieve unprecedented sensitivity to Earth-like planets in the habitable zone. Here, we present a framework to simulate HDC observations and data analyses. The goal of these simulations is to perform a detailed analysis of the trade-off between raw star light suppression and spectral resolution for various instrument configurations, target types, and science cases. We predict the performance of an HDC instrument at Keck observatory for characterizing directly imaged gas-giant planets in near-infrared bands. We also simulate HDC observations of an Earth-like planet using next-generation ground-based (TMT) and spaced-base telescopes (HabEx and LUVOIR). We conclude that ground-based ELTs are more suitable for HDC observations of an Earth-like planet than future space-based missions owing to the considerable difference in collecting area. For ground-based telescopes, HDC observations can detect an Earth-like planet in the habitable zone around an M-dwarf star at 10−4 star light suppression level. Compared to the 10−7 planet/star contrast, HDC relaxes the star light suppression requirement by a factor of 103. For space-based telescopes, detector noise will be a major limitation at spectral resolutions higher than 104. Considering detector noise and speckle chromatic noise, R = 400 (1600) is the optimal spectral resolutions for HabEx (LUVOIR). The corresponding star light suppression requirement to detect a planet with planet/star contrast = is relaxed by a factor of 10 (100) for HabEx (LUVOIR).","astronomy"
"The statistical results of transiting planets show that there are two peaks, around 1.5 and 2.0, in the distribution of orbital period ratios. A large number of planet pairs are found near the exact location of mean motion resonances (MMRs). In this work, we find that the depletion and structures of the gas disk play crucial roles in driving planet pairs out of the exact location of MMRs. Under such a scenario, planet pairs are trapped into exact MMRs during orbital migration first and keep migrating at the same pace. The eccentricities can be excited. Due to the existence of a gas disk, eccentricities can be damped, leading to a change in orbital period, which will make planet pairs depart from the exact location of MMRs. With depletion timescales larger than 1 Myr, near-MMR configurations are formed easily. Planet pairs have higher possibilities of escaping from MMRs with a higher disk aspect ratio. Additionally, with a weaker corotation torque, planet pairs can depart farther from the exact location of MMRs. The final location of the innermost planets in the systems are directly related to the transition radius from the optically thick region to the outer optically thin disk. While the transition radius is smaller than 0.2 au at the late stage of the star evolution process, the period of the inner planets can reach around 10 days. Our formation scenario is a possible mechanism for explaining the formation of near-MMR configurations with the innermost planet farther than 0.1 au.","astronomy"
"We propose that TIC 448892817 is a double-mode high-amplitude δ Scuti star. The radial modes detected in this star provide a unique opportunity to exploit asteroseismic techniques up to their limits. 30 significant frequencies are detected by frequency analysis, while two of them are independent frequencies, i.e., F0 = 13.43538(2) day−1 and F1 = 17.27007(4) day−1. The ratio of f 1/f 2 is measured to be 0.777957(2), suggesting that this target is a double-mode δ Scuti star. Nearly all the light variation is due to these two modes and their combination frequencies, but several other frequencies of very low amplitude are also present. The stellar evolutionary models were constructed with different mass M and metallicity Z using Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA). The frequency ratio f 1/f 2 obtained by the model is smaller than those obtained by observation. This might be caused by the rotation of the star pointing that rotational effects are more important than previously thought in HADS stars. This is something that deserves to be investigated in future works with models including rotational effects for moderate to intermediate rotators such as FILOU. On the other hand, the parameters obtained from MESA agree well with previous results as well as by observational spectra. The best-fitting model shows that TIC 448892817 is close to entering the first turnoff of the main sequence. In order to accurately determine the effective temperature and metallicities, thus further narrowing the parameter space of this star, we suggest high-resolution spectra is highly desired in the future.","astronomy"
"The recently rediscovered open cluster Stock 2, located roughly 375 pc away and about 400 Myr old, has the potential to be an exciting new testbed for our understanding of stellar evolution. We present results from a spectroscopic campaign to characterize stars near the cluster’s main-sequence turnoff; our goal is to identify candidate chemically peculiar stars among the cluster’s A stars. We obtained échelle spectra for 64 cluster members with ESPaDOnS on the 3.6 m Canada–France–Hawaii Telescope, Maunakea Observatory, USA, and for six stars with SOPHIE on the 1.93 m telescope at the Observatoire de Haute-Provence, France. We complemented these new observations with those of 13 high-mass cluster members from the HARPS-N archive; our overall sample is of 71 stars. We derived the fundamental parameters (T eff, log g , [M/H]) as well as v e sin i for our sample using the sliced inverse regression technique, and then used iSpec to derive individual abundances of 12 chemical species. With these abundance determinations, we identified nine A stars with anomalous levels of Sc, Ca, and other metallic lines. Follow-up observations of these Am candidates with a known age can transform them into benchmarks for evolutionary models that include atomic diffusion and help build a better understanding of the complex interactions between macroscopic and microscopic processes in stellar interiors.","astronomy"

"On 2017 August 21, the Airborne Infrared Spectrometer (AIR-Spec) observed the total solar eclipse at an altitude of 14 km from aboard the NSF/NCAR Gulfstream V research aircraft.

Such a strong polarization in breakout regions has not been observed in any other SNR.","astronomy"
"Some properties of the configuration space (CS) of charged black holes (BH) we are considered. A reduced action for the spherically symmetric configuration of the gravitational and electromagnetic fields is constructed. We restrict ourselves to considering of T-region, where the studied fields have a dynamic meaning. Using the Hamiltonian constraint, we exclude the nondynamic degree of freedom. This leads to the action of the system in the CS with the corresponding supermetric. It turns out that the CS is flat, and its metric admits a twoparametric group of motions. This group generates conservation laws for the geodesic equations. The first law is the charge conservation law, and second is the mass conservation law (the mass function). Using the Hamiltonian constraint, they allow one to find momenta as a function of the field variables andcalculate the action as a function of the conserved quantities and field variables in CS. We emphasize that to find this action, we use only the integrability condition for a differential form. The quantization of the system is reduced to the uantization of a free particle in a three-dimensional pseudo-Euclidean space. The natural measure corresponding to the CS metric is used to construct the Hermitian DeWitt and mass operators. Based on the self-consistent solution of quantum DeWitt equations and equations for the eigenvalues of the mass and charge operators, the wave function for the spherically symmetric configuration of the gravitational and electromagnetic fields in the T- region is constructed. As a result, we get a model of charged BH with continuous mass and charge spectra.","astronomy"
"We report on the discovery and characterization of the transiting planet K2-39b (EPIC 206247743b). With an orbital period of 4.6 days, it is the shortest-period planet orbiting a subgiant star known to date. Such planets are rare, with only a handful of known cases. The reason for this is poorly understood but may reflect differences in planet occurrence around the relatively high-mass stars that have been surveyed, or may be the result of tidal destruction of such planets. K2-39 (EPIC 206247743) is an evolved star with a spectroscopically derived stellar radius and mass of and , respectively, and a very close-in transiting planet, with . Radial velocity (RV) follow-up using the HARPS, FIES, and PFS instruments leads to a planetary mass of . In combination with a radius measurement of , this results in a mean planetary density of g cm−3. We furthermore discover a long-term RV trend, which may be caused by a long-period planet or stellar companion. Because K2-39b has a short orbital period, its existence makes it seem unlikely that tidal destruction is wholly responsible for the differences in planet populations around subgiant and main-sequence stars. Future monitoring of the transits of this system may enable the detection of period decay and constrain the tidal dissipation rates of subgiant stars.","astronomy"
"High-resolution spectroscopic observations of the W UMa-type binary ϵ CrA obtained as a time-monitoring sequence on four full and four partial nights within two weeks have been used to derive orbital elements of the system and discuss the validity of the Lucy model for description of the radial-velocity data. The observations had more extensive temporal coverage and better quality than similar time-sequence observations of the contact binary AW UMa. The two binaries share several physical properties and show very similar deviations from the Lucy model: the primary component is a rapidly rotating star almost unaffected by the presence of the secondary component, while the latter is embedded in a complex gas flow and appears to have its own rotation-velocity field, in contradiction to the model. The spectroscopic mass ratio is found to be larger than the one derived from the light-curve analysis, as in many other W UMa-type binaries, but the discrepancy for ϵ CrA is relatively minor, much smaller than for AW UMa. The presence of the complex velocity flows contradicting the assumption of solid-body rotation suggests a necessity of modification to the Lucy model, possibly along the lines outlined by Stȩpień in his concept of energy transfer between the binary components.","astronomy"
"We report 272 radial velocities for 19 RR Lyrae variables. For most of the stars we have radial velocities for the complete pulsation cycle. These data are used to determine robust center-of-mass radial velocities that have been compared to values from the literature in a search for evidence of binary systems. Center-of-mass velocities were determined for each star using Fourier Series and template fits to the radial velocities. Our center-of-mass velocities have uncertainties from ±0.16 km s−1 to ±2.5 km s−1, with a mean uncertainty of ±0.92 km s−1. We combined our center-of-mass velocities with values from the literature to look for deviations from the mean center-of-mass velocity of each star. Fifteen RR Lyrae show no evidence of binary motion (BK And, CI And, Z CVn, DM Cyg, BK Dra, RR Gem, XX Hya, SZ Leo, BX Leo, TT Lyn, CN Lyr, TU Per, U Tri, RV UMa, and AV Vir). In most cases this conclusion is reached due to the sporadic sampling of the center-of-mass velocities over time. Three RR Lyrae show suspicious variation in the center-of-mass velocities that may indicate binary motion but do not prove it (SS Leo, ST Leo, and AO Peg). TU UMa was observed by us near a predicted periastron passage (at 0.14 in orbital phase) but the absence of additional center-of-mass velocities near periastron makes the binary detection, based on radial velocities alone, uncertain. Two stars in our sample show Hγ emission in phases 0.9–1.0: SS Leo and TU UMa.","astronomy"
"Atmospheric parameters and elemental abundances of metal-poor Population II star TYC5594-576-1 ([Fe/H] = –2.8) have been studied, including the elements of neutron (n-) capture processes, as an important part of the enrichment sources of early Galaxy. Na, Mg, Al, Co, Sr, Y, Zr, Mo, Ba, La, Ce, Pr, Sm, Eu, Gd, Dy, Os, and Th abundances were determined using the synthetic spectrum method, taken into account the hyperfine structure (HFS) for the Ba II, La II and Eu II lines. The abundances of Si, Ca, Sc, N were determined based on the equivalent widths of their lines. The carbon abundance was obtained by the molecular synthesis fitting for the CH region of 4300-4330 ÅÅ. For the abundances determinations of C, Na, Mg, Al, Ba, and Th the NLTE corrections have been applied.We have determined the abundances of several n- capture elements for the first time and found that the behaviour of these elements abundances shows a significant trend with increasing atomic number. The elements ratios of [Eu/Fe] = 1.85, [Ba/Eu] = –1.24, [Sr/Ba] = –1.04 confirm the status of TYC5594-576-1 as a r-process enrichment star, with lower strontium [Sr/Fe] = –0.33 and higher thorium [Th/Fe] = 1.28 abundances. The obtained europium and thorium excesses testifies to the early enrichment of the Galaxy by the r-process elements as a result of the merger of neutron stars or black holes. The carbon abundance confirms the effect of canonical additional mixing in this star.","astronomy"
"OSIRIS is a near-infrared (1.0–2.4 μm) integral field spectrograph operating behind the adaptive optics system at Keck Observatory and one of the first lenslet-based integral field spectrographs. Since its commissioning in 2005, it has been a productive instrument, producing nearly half the laser guide star adaptive optics papers on Keck. The complexity of its raw data format necessitated a custom data reduction pipeline (DRP) delivered with the instrument in order to iteratively assign flux in overlapping spectra to the proper spatial and spectral locations in a data cube. Other than bug fixes and updates required for hardware upgrades, the bulk of the DRP has not been updated since initial instrument commissioning. We report on the first major comprehensive characterization of the DRP using on-sky and calibration data. We also detail improvements to the DRP, including characterization of the flux assignment algorithm, exploration of spatial rippling in the reduced data cubes, and improvements to several calibration files, including the rectification matrix, bad-pixel mask, and wavelength solution. We present lessons learned from over a decade of OSIRIS data reduction that are relevant to the next generation of integral field spectrograph hardware and data reduction software design.","astronomy"
"We have developed a software library for chemical evolution simulations of galaxy formation under the simple stellar population (SSP) approximation. In this library, all of the necessary components concerning chemical evolution, such as initial mass functions, stellar lifetimes, yields from Type II and Type Ia supernovae, asymptotic giant branch stars, and neutron star mergers, are compiled from the literature. Various models are pre-implemented in this library so that users can choose their favorite combination of models. Subroutines of this library return released energy and masses of individual elements depending on a given event type. Since the redistribution manner of these quantities depends on the implementation of users’ simulation codes, this library leaves it up to the simulation code. As demonstrations, we carry out both one-zone, closed-box simulations and 3D simulations of a collapsing gas and dark matter system using this library. In these simulations, we can easily compare the impact of individual models on the chemical evolution of galaxies, just by changing the control flags and parameters of the library. Since this library only deals with the part of chemical evolution under the SSP approximation, any simulation codes that use the SSP approximation—namely, particle-base and mesh codes, as well as semianalytical models—can use it. This library is named “CELib” after the term “Chemical Evolution Library” and is made available to the community.","astronomy"
"We used the new high spectral resolution cross-dispersed facility spectrograph, iSHELL, at the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility on Maunakea, HI, to observe Jupiter-family comet (JFC) 45P/Honda–Mrkos–Pajdušáková. We report water production rates, as well as production rates and abundance ratios relative to H2O, for eight trace parent molecules (native ices), CO, CH4, H2CO, CH3OH, HCN, NH3, C2H2, and C2H6, on 2 days spanning UT 2017 January 6/7 and 7/8, shortly following perihelion. Trace species were measured simultaneously with H2O and/or OH prompt emission, a proxy for H2O production, thereby providing a robust and consistent means of establishing the native ice composition of 45P. Its favorable geocentric radial velocity (approximately −35 km s−1) permitted sensitive measures of the “hypervolatiles” CO and CH4, which are substantially undercharacterized in JFCs. Our results represent the most precise ground-based measures of CO and CH4 to date in a JFC, providing a foundation for building meaningful statistics regarding their abundances. The abundance ratio for CH4 in 45P (0.79% ± 0.06% relative to H2O) was consistent with its median value as measured among Oort Cloud comets, whereas CO (0.60% ± 0.04%) was strongly depleted. Compared with all measured comets, HCN (0.049% ± 0.012%) was strongly depleted, CH3OH (3.6% ± 0.3%) was enriched, and the remaining species were consistent with their respective median abundances. The volatile composition measured for 45P could indicate processing of ices prior to their incorporation into its nucleus. Spatial analysis of emissions suggests enhanced release of more volatile species into the sunward-facing hemisphere of the coma.","astronomy"
"We obtained high-resolution (λ/Δλ ∼ 25,000) pre-perihelion spectra of Comet C/2013 V5 (Oukaimeden) using NIRSPEC at Keck II on UT 2014 September 5–6, and CSHELL at the NASA-Infrared Telescope Facility on September 11–13, altogether spanning a range in heliocentric distance R h = 0.789–0.698 au. We report water production rates, and production rates and abundance ratios relative to co-measured H2O for eight trace molecules: CO, H2CO, CH3OH, CH4, C2H2, C2H6, HCN, and NH3. Our measured water production rates from NIRSPEC and CSHELL observations remained relatively constant and were close to those from SOHO/Solar Wind ANisotropies observations that encompassed our dates, suggesting H2O production dominated by release directly from or within approximately 2000 km of the nucleus. All trace volatiles were depleted relative to their respective median abundances among comets, excepting NH3, which was consistent with its median abundance. Most surprising were pronounced increases in abundance ratios for CH3OH (by 51% relative to simultaneously measured H2O) and especially C2H6 (by 87%) between September 5 and 6. On September 5, C2H6 was severely depleted, consistent with its lowest abundance yet measured for any comet. It also tracked the spatial profile of H2O, suggesting C2H6 was associated with a polar ice phase dominating gas production. On September 6, C2H6 was only moderately depleted and was spatially distinct from H2O, suggesting both polar- and nonpolar-dominated ice phases contributed to the activity then. Our results are consistent with a nonhomogeneous volatile composition for C/2013 V5, implying differential processing of its constituent ices.","astronomy"
"We present new near-ultraviolet (NUV, λ = 2479–3306 Å) transmission spectroscopy of KELT-9b, the hottest known exoplanet, obtained with the Colorado Ultraviolet Transit Experiment CubeSat. Two transits were observed on 2022 September 28th and September 29th, referred to as Visits 1 and 2 respectively. Using a combined transit and systematics model for each visit, the best-fit broadband NUV light curves are R p/R ⋆ = 0.136 − 0.0146 + 0.0125 for Visit 1 and R p/R ⋆ = 0.111 − 0.0190 + 0.0162 for Visit 2, appearing an average of 1.54× larger in the NUV than at optical wavelengths. While the systematics between the two visits vary considerably, the two broadband NUV light curves are consistent with each other. A transmission spectrum with 25 Å bins suggests a general trend of excess absorption in the NUV, consistent with expectations for ultrahot Jupiters. Although we see an extended atmosphere in the NUV, the reduced data lack the sensitivity to probe individual spectral lines.","astronomy"
"Putative natural massive satellites (exomoons) have gained increasing attention when they orbit Jupiter-like planets within the habitable zone of their host main-sequence star S. An exomoon s is expected to move within the equatorial plane of its host planet p, with its spin S s aligned with its orbital angular momentum L , which, in turn, is parallel to the planetary spin S p. If, in particular, the common tilt ε of such angular momenta to the plane of the satellite–planet motion about the star, assumed fixed, has certain values, the stellar latitudinal irradiation experienced on the exomoon may allow it to sustain life as we know it, at least for certain orbital configurations. An Earth analog (similar in mass, radius, oblateness, and obliquity) is considered, which orbits within 5–10 planetary radii R p from its Jupiter-like host planet. The de Sitter and Lense–Thirring spin precessions due to the general relativistic post-Newtonian (pN) field of the host planet have an impact on an exomoon’s habitability for a variety of different initial spin–orbit configurations. Here I show it by identifying long-term variations in the satellite’s obliquity ε s, where variations can be ≲10°–100°, depending on the initial spin–orbit configuration, with a timescale of ≃0.1–1 million years. Also the satellite’s quadrupole mass moment J 2 s induces obliquity variations that are faster than the pN ones but do not cancel them. Tidal dissipations, which may potentially have a relevant impact on the outlined pattern, are not included in the present analysis.","astronomy"
"Albeit the discovery of thousands of extrasolar planets, so far no exomoon has been found. This may be due to a lack of dynamical investigation of the best regions around the planets for a satellite to exist. We provide a list of the best candidates of exomoon hosting planets using the Kepler database. The inner and outer stability boundaries of an exomoon orbital semimajor axis were calculated for all planets. The first limit is the minimum distance to the planet such that the object will not disintegrate due to tidal forces, the Roche limit, that depends on the moon density. The outer boundary is the region where an exomoon may exist for a long period of time. Both limits are a function of the planet mass, calculated from its radius inferred from the observed transit depth. Each planet has been tested with the exomoon mass estimated for three values of moon–planet distance, and the moon radius for five different densities (ice, ice–rock, rock, rock–iron, and iron), totalling 15 different combinations. For the planet to be considered a suitable exomoon host, the system has to pass three criteria: (i) the planet–moon distance should be greater than the Roche limit; (ii) the system center-of-mass is within the planet; and (iii) the moon transit depth is greater than twice the light-curve noise (Combined Differential Photometric Precision). After processing all the data, 54 planets were left from the Kepler list with putative “visible” satellites, thus providing the best candidates for an exomoon search.","astronomy"
"We test the mutual consistency between the baryon acoustic oscillation measurements from the eBOSS SDSS final release and the Pantheon supernova compilation in a model-independent fashion using Gaussian process regression. We also test their joint consistency with the ΛCDM model in a model-independent fashion. We also use Gaussian process regression to reconstruct the expansion history that is preferred by these two data sets. While this methodology finds no significant preference for model flexibility beyond ΛCDM, we are able to generate a number of reconstructed expansion histories that fit the data better than the best-fit ΛCDM model. These example expansion histories may point the way toward modifications to ΛCDM. We also constrain the parameters Ω k and H 0 r d both with ΛCDM and with Gaussian process regression. We find that H 0 r d = 10,030 ± 130 km s−1 and Ω k = 0.05 ± 0.10 for ΛCDM and that H 0 r d = 10,040 ± 140 km s−1 and Ω k = 0.02 ± 0.20 for the Gaussian process case.","astronomy"
"One of the unique features associated with the Earth is that the fraction of its surface covered by land is comparable to that spanned by its oceans and other water bodies. Here, we investigate how extraterrestrial biospheres depend on the ratio of the surficial land and water fractions. We find that worlds that are overwhelmingly dominated by landmasses or oceans are likely to have sparse biospheres. Our analysis suggests that major evolutionary events such as the build-up of O2 in the atmosphere and the emergence of technological intelligence might be relatively feasible only on a small subset of worlds with surface water fractions ranging approximately between 30% and 90%. We also discuss how our predictions can be evaluated by future observations and the implications for the prevalence of microbial and technological species in the universe.","astronomy"
"The Breakthrough Listen search for intelligent life is, to date, the most extensive technosignature search of nearby celestial objects. We present a radio technosignature search of the centers of 97 nearby galaxies, observed by Breakthrough Listen at the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope. We performed a narrowband Doppler drift search using the turboSETI pipeline with a minimum signal-to-noise parameter threshold of 10, across a drift rate range of ±4 Hz s−1, with a spectral resolution of 3 Hz and a time resolution of ∼18.25 s. We removed radio frequency interference (RFI) by using an on-source/off-source cadence pattern of six observations and discarding signals with Doppler drift rates of 0. We assess factors affecting the sensitivity of the Breakthrough Listen data reduction and search pipeline using signal injection and recovery techniques and apply new methods for the investigation of the RFI environment. We present results in four frequency bands covering 1–11 GHz, and place constraints on the presence of transmitters with equivalent isotropic radiated power on the order of 1026 W, corresponding to the theoretical power consumption of Kardashev Type II civilizations.","astronomy"
"We present the complete sample of protoplanetary disks from the Gemini- Large Imaging with the Gemini Planet Imager Herbig/T Tauri Survey, which observed bright Herbig Ae/Be stars and T Tauri stars in near-infrared polarized light to search for signatures of disk evolution and ongoing planet formation. The 44 targets were chosen based on their near- and mid-infrared colors, with roughly equal numbers of transitional, pre-transitional, and full disks. Our approach explicitly did not favor well-known, “famous” disks or those observed by the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, resulting in a less-biased sample suitable to probe the major stages of disk evolution during planet formation. Our optimized data reduction allowed polarized flux as low as 0.002% of the stellar light to be detected, and we report polarized scattered light around 80% of our targets. We detected point-like companions for 47% of the targets, including three brown dwarfs (two confirmed, one new), and a new super-Jupiter-mass candidate around V1295 Aql. We searched for correlations between the polarized flux and system parameters, finding a few clear trends: the presence of a companion drastically reduces the polarized flux levels, far-IR excess correlates with polarized flux for nonbinary systems, and systems hosting disks with ring structures have stellar masses &lt;3 M⊙. Our sample also included four hot, dusty “FS CMa” systems, and we detected large-scale ( &gt;100 au) scattered light around each, signs of extreme youth for these enigmatic systems. Science-ready images are publicly available through multiple distribution channels using a new FITS file standard that has been jointly developed with members of the Very Large Telescope Spectro-polarimetric High-contrast Exoplanet Research team.","astronomy"
"In the Tycho-2 catalogue system the processing of 1529 photographic plates of the FON Dushanbe project from the collection of the Institute of Astrophysics of the National Academy of Sciences of Tajikistan was completed. The photographic plates with the size of 8º×8º (30x30 cm) were exposed in the zones from -8º to + 84º in the period of 1985-1992 years. In years 2017 – 2020 the plates were digitized using a Microtek ScanMaker 1000XL Plus scanner with the resolution of 1200 dpi, so the size of the digitized images is near 13000x13000 px. Based on the results of the processing of digitized images a catalogue of equatorial coordinates α, δ and B-magnitudes of stars for the northern hemisphere of the sky was created. The catalog contains about 30 million stars and galaxies for the epoch 1988.74. The average internal accuracy of the catalogue for all objects is σαδ = ±0.32"" and σB = ± 0.11 m (for stars in the range of B = 8 m -14 m the errors are σαδ = ±0.19"" and σB =±0.07 m ) for equatorial coordinates and B-magnitudes respectively. The convergence between calculated and reference positions from the Tycho-2 catalogue is σαδ = ±0.07"" and the convergence with photoelectric B-magnitudes is σB = ±0.16 m . Five astronomical institutions took part in the processing of the photographic plates and in the creating of the FON-Dushanbe catalogue: Institute of Astrophysics of NAS of Tajikistan; Walter Hohmann Observatory, Essen, Germany; Ulugh Beg Astronomical Institute UAS, Uzbekistan; Research Institute “Mykolaiv Astronomical Observatory”, Ukraine and Main Astronomical Observatory NASU, Ukraine.","astronomy"
"Mean plane measurements of the Kuiper Belt from observational data are of interest for their potential to test dynamical models of the solar system. Recent measurements have yielded inconsistent results. Here we report a measurement of the Kuiper Belt’s mean plane with a sample size more than twice as large as in previous measurements. The sample of interest is the nonresonant Kuiper Belt objects, which we identify by using machine learning on the observed Kuiper Belt population whose orbits are well determined. We estimate the measurement error with a Monte Carlo procedure. We find that the overall mean plane of the nonresonant Kuiper Belt (semimajor axis range of 35–150 au) and also that of the classical Kuiper Belt (semimajor axis range of 42–48 au) are both close to (within ∼0.°7) but distinguishable from the invariable plane of the solar system to greater than 99.7% confidence. When binning the sample into smaller semimajor axis bins, we find the measured mean plane is mostly consistent with both the invariable plane and the theoretically expected Laplace surface forced by the known planets. Statistically significant discrepancies are found only in the semimajor axis ranges 40.3–42 au and 45–50 au; these ranges are in proximity to the ν 8 secular resonance and Neptune’s 2:1 mean motion resonance where the theory for the Laplace surface is likely to be inaccurate. These results do not support a previously reported anomalous warp at semimajor axes above 50 au.","astronomy"
"In the absence of dense photometry for a large population of near-Earth objects (NEOs), the best method of obtaining a shape distribution comes from sparse photometry and partial light curves. We have used 867 partial light curves obtained by Spitzer to determine a shape distribution for subkilometer NEOs. From this data we find a best-fit average elongation of . We compare this result with a shape distribution obtained from 1869 NEOs in the same size range observed by Pan-STARRS 1 (PS1) and find the Spitzer-obtained elongation to be in excellent agreement with this PS1 value of . These values are also in agreement with literature values for 1 &lt; D &lt; 10 km objects in the main asteroid belt, however, there is a size discrepancy between the two data sets. Using a smaller sample of NEOs in the size range of 1 &lt; D &lt; 5 km from PS1 data, we obtain an average axis ratio of b/a = 0.70 ± 0.12. This is more elongated than the shape distribution for main belt objects in the same size regime, although the current uncertainties are sizeable and this should be verified using a larger data set. As future large surveys come online it will be possible to observe smaller main belt asteroids to allow for better comparisons of different subkilometer populations.","astronomy"
"Jupiter Trojans (JTs) librate about the Lagrangian stationary centers L4 and L5 associated with this planet on typically small-eccentricity and moderate-inclination heliocentric orbits. The physical and orbital properties of JTs provide important clues about the dynamical evolution of the giant planets in the early solar system, as well as populations of planetesimals in their source regions. Here we use decade-long observations from the Catalina Sky Survey (station G96) to determine the bias-corrected orbital and magnitude distributions of JTs. We distinguish the background JT population, filling smoothly the long-term stable orbital zone about L4 and L5 points and collisional families. We find that the cumulative magnitude distribution of JTs (the background population in our case) has a steep slope for H ≤ 9, followed by a moderately shallow slope until H ≃ 14.5, beyond which the distribution becomes even shallower. At H = 15 we find a local power-law exponent 0.38 ± 0.01. We confirm the asymmetry between the magnitude-limited background populations in L4 and L5 clouds characterized by a ratio 1.45 ± 0.05 for H &lt; 15. Our analysis suggests an asymmetry in the inclination distribution of JTs, with the L4 population being tighter and the L5 population being broader. We also provide a new catalog of the synthetic proper elements for JTs with an updated identification of statistically robust families (9 at L4, and 4 at L5). The previously known Ennomos family is found to consist of two overlapping Deiphobus and Ennomos families.","astronomy"
"Short-period comet 108P/Ciffreo is known for its peculiar double morphology, in which the nucleus is accompanied by a comoving, detached, diffuse “blob.” We report new observations of 108P/Ciffreo taken with the Hubble Space Telescope and the Nordic Optical Telescope and use them to determine the cause of this unusual morphology. The separation and the longevity of the blob across several orbits together rule out the possibility of a single, slow-moving secondary object near the primary nucleus. We use a model of coma particle dynamics under the action of solar gravity and radiation pressure to show that the blob is an artifact of the turnaround of particles ejected sunward and repelled by sunlight. Numerical experiments limit the range of directions which can reproduce the morphology and explain why the comoving blob appearance is rare.","astronomy"
"A stable-frequency transmitter with relative radial acceleration to a receiver will show a change in received frequency over time, known as a “drift rate.” For a transmission from an exoplanet, we must account for multiple components of drift rate: the exoplanet’s orbit and rotation, the Earth’s orbit and rotation, and other contributions. Understanding the drift rate distribution produced by exoplanets relative to Earth, can (a) help us constrain the range of drift rates to check in a Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence project to detect radio technosignatures, and (b) help us decide validity of signals-of-interest, as we can compare drifting signals with expected drift rates from the target star. In this paper, we modeled the drift rate distribution for ∼5300 confirmed exoplanets, using parameters from the NASA Exoplanet Archive (NEA). We find that confirmed exoplanets have drift rates such that 99% of them fall within the ±53 nHz range. This implies a distribution-informed maximum drift rate ∼4 times lower than previous work. To mitigate the observational biases inherent in the NEA, we also simulated an exoplanet population built to reduce these biases. The results suggest that, for a Kepler-like target star without known exoplanets, ±0.44 nHz would be sufficient to account for 99% of signals. This reduction in recommended maximum drift rate is partially due to inclination effects and bias toward short orbital periods in the NEA. These narrowed drift rate maxima will increase the efficiency of searches and save significant computational effort in future radio technosignature searches.","astronomy"
"We present Data Release 2 of the Point Source Catalogue created from a series of previously constructed radio-continuum images of M31 at ?=20 cm (v=1.4 GHz) from archived VLA observations. In total, we identify a collection of 916 unique discrete radio sources across the field of M31. Comparing these detected sources to those listed by Gelfand et al. (2004) at ?=92 cm, the spectral index of 98 sources has been derived. The majority (73%) of these sources exhibit a spectral index of ?&lt;-0.6, indicating that their emission is predominantly non-thermal in nature, which is typical for background objects and Supernova Remnants (SNRs). Additionally, we investigate the presence of radio counterparts for some 156 SNRs and SNR candidates, finding a total of only 13 of these objects in our images within a 500 search area. Auxiliary optical, radio and X-ray catalogues were cross referenced highlighting a small population of SNRs and SNR candidates common to multi frequency domains.","astronomy"
"The Polarisation Sky Survey of the Universe’s Magnetism (POSSUM) will conduct a sensitive ∼1 GHz radio polarization survey covering 20,000 deg2 of the southern sky with the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder. In anticipation of the full survey, we analyze pilot observations of low-band (800–1087 MHz), mid-band (1316–1439 MHz), and combined-band observations for an extragalactic field and a Galactic plane field (low-band only). Using the POSSUM processing pipeline, we produce prototype rotation measure (RM) catalogs that are filtered to construct prototype RM grids. We assess typical RM grid densities and RM uncertainties and their dependence on frequency, bandwidth, and Galactic latitude. We present a median filter method for separating foreground diffuse emission from background components and find that after application of the filter, 99.5% of the measured RMs of simulated sources are within 3σ of their true RM, with a typical loss of polarized intensity of 5% ± 5%. We find RM grid densities of 35.1, 30.6, 37.2, and 13.5 RMs per square degree and median uncertainties on RM measurements of 1.55, 12.82, 1.06, and 1.89 rad m−2 for the median-filtered low-band, mid-band, combined-band, and Galactic observations, respectively. We estimate that the full POSSUM survey will produce an RM catalog of ∼775,000 RMs with median-filtered low-band observations and ∼877,000 RMs with median-filtered combined-band observations. We construct a structure function from the Galactic RM catalog, which shows a break at 0.°7, corresponding to a physical scale of 12–24 pc for the nearest spiral arm.","astronomy"
"We present photometry of images from the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) of over 400 million sources detected by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We use a “forced photometry” technique, using measured SDSS source positions, star–galaxy classification, and galaxy profiles to define the sources whose fluxes are to be measured in the WISE images. We perform photometry with The Tractor image modeling code, working on our “unWISE” coaddds and taking account of the WISE point-spread function and a noise model. The result is a measurement of the flux of each SDSS source in each WISE band. Many sources have little flux in the WISE bands, so often the measurements we report are consistent with zero given our uncertainties. However, for many sources we get 3σ or 4σ measurements; these sources would not be reported by the “official” WISE pipeline and will not appear in the WISE catalog, yet they can be highly informative for some scientific questions. In addition, these small-signal measurements can be used in stacking analyses at the catalog level. The forced photometry approach has the advantage that we measure a consistent set of sources between SDSS and WISE, taking advantage of the resolution and depth of the SDSS images to interpret the WISE images; objects that are resolved in SDSS but blended together in WISE still have accurate measurements in our photometry. Our results, and the code used to produce them, are publicly available at http://unwise.me.","astronomy"
"All-sky photometric time-series missions have allowed for the monitoring of thousands of young (t age &lt; 800 Myr) stars in order to understand the evolution of stellar activity. Here, we developed a convolutional neural network (CNN), stella, specifically trained to find flares in Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) short-cadence data. We applied the network to 3200 young stars in order to evaluate flare rates as a function of age and spectral type. The CNN takes a few seconds to identify flares on a single light curve. We also measured rotation periods for 1500 of our targets and find that flares of all amplitudes are present across all spot phases, suggesting high spot coverage across the entire surface. Additionally, flare rates and amplitudes decrease for stars t age &gt; 50 Myr across all temperatures T eff ≥ 4000 K, while stars from 2300 ≤ T eff &lt; 4000 K show no evolution across 800 Myr. Stars of T eff ≤ 4000 K also show higher flare rates and amplitudes across all ages. We investigate the effects of high flare rates on photoevaporative atmospheric mass loss for young planets. In the presence of flares, planets lose 4%–7% more atmosphere over the first 1 Gyr. stella is an open-source Python toolkit hosted on GitHub and PyPI.","astronomy"
"In this work, we derive a spatially resolved map of the line-of-sight velocity of the interstellar medium and use it, along with a second map of line-of-sight velocity from Paper I of this series, to determine the nature of the gaseous spiral structure in the Milky Way (MW). This map is derived from measurements of the 1.527 μm diffuse interstellar band (DIB) in stellar spectra from the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment survey and covers the nearest 4–5 kpc of the Northern Galactic plane. We cross-check this new DIB-based line-of-sight velocity map with the map derived in Paper I and find that they agree. We then compare these maps with line-of-sight velocity maps derived from simulations of quasi-stationary density wave spiral structure and dynamic, or material, spiral structure in a MW-like galaxy. While none of the maps derived from these simulations is an exact match to the measured velocity field of the MW, the measurements are more consistent with simulations of dynamic spiral structure. In the dynamic spiral structure simulation that best matches the measurements, the Perseus spiral arm is being disrupted.","astronomy"
"We observed eclipses of the transiting brown dwarf CWW 89Ab at 3.6 and 4.5 μm using Spitzer/IRAC. The CWW 89 binary system is a member of the 3.0 ± 0.25 Gyr old open cluster Ruprecht 147 and is composed of a Sun-like primary and an early M-dwarf secondary separated by a projected distance of 25 au. CWW 89Ab has a radius of 0.937 ± 0.042 and a mass of 36.5 ± 0.1 , and is on a 5.3 day orbit about CWW 89A with a non-zero eccentricity of e = 0.19. We strongly detect the eclipses of CWW 89Ab in both Spitzer channels as δ 3.6 = 1147 ± 213 ppm and δ 4.5 = 1097 ± 225 ppm after correcting for the dilution from CWW 89B. After accounting for the irradiation that CWW 89Ab receives from its host star, these measurements imply that the brown dwarf has an internal luminosity of . This is 16 times, or 9.3σ, higher than model predictions given the known mass, radius, and age of CWW 89Ab. As we discuss, this overluminosity is explainable neither by an inaccurate age determination, nor additional stellar heating, nor tidal heating. Instead, we suggest that the anomalous luminosity of CWW 89Ab is caused by a dayside temperature inversion—though a significant error in the evolutionary models is also a possibility. Importantly, a temperature inversion would require a superstellar C/O ratio in CWW 89Ab’s atmosphere. If this is indeed the case, it implies that CWW 89Ab is a 36.5 object that formed via core accretion processes. Finally, we use our measurement of CWW 89Ab’s orbital eccentricity, improved via these observations, to constrain the tidal quality factors of the brown dwarf and the host star CWW 89A to be and , respectively.","astronomy"
"We carried out a systematic study of full-orbit phase curves for known transiting systems in the northern ecliptic sky that were observed during Year 2 of the TESS primary mission. We applied the same methodology for target selection, data processing, and light-curve fitting as we did in our Year 1 study. Out of the 15 transiting systems selected for analysis, seven—HAT-P-7, KELT-1, KELT-9, KELT-16, KELT-20, Kepler-13A, and WASP-12—show statistically significant secondary eclipses and day–night atmospheric brightness modulations. Small eastward dayside hot-spot offsets were measured for KELT-9b and WASP-12b. KELT-1, Kepler-13A, and WASP-12 show additional phase-curve variability attributed to the tidal distortion of the host star; the amplitudes of these signals are consistent with theoretical predictions. We combined occultation measurements from TESS and Spitzer to compute dayside brightness temperatures, TESS-band geometric albedos, Bond albedos, and phase integrals for several systems. The new albedo values solidify the previously reported trend between dayside temperature and geometric albedo for planets with 1500 K &lt; T day &lt; 3000 K. For Kepler-13Ab, we carried out an atmospheric retrieval of the full secondary eclipse spectrum, which revealed a noninverted temperature–pressure profile, significant H2O and K absorption in the near-infrared, evidence for strong optical atmospheric opacity due to sodium, and a confirmation of the high geometric albedo inferred from our simpler analysis. We explore the implications of the phase integrals (ratios of Bond to geometric albedos) for understanding exoplanet clouds. We also report updated transit ephemerides for all of the systems studied in this work.","astronomy"
"We present updated radial-velocity (RV) analyses of the AU Mic system. AU Mic is a young (22 Myr) early-M dwarf known to host two transiting planets—P b ∼ 8.46 days, R b = 4.38 − 0.18 + 0.18 R ⊕ , P c ∼ 18.86 days, R c = 3.51 − 0.16 + 0.16 R ⊕ . With visible RVs from Calar Alto high-Resolution search for M dwarfs with Exo-earths with Near-infrared and optical echelle Spectrographs (CARMENES)-VIS, CHIRON, HARPS, HIRES, Minerva-Australis, and Tillinghast Reflector Echelle Spectrograph, as well as near-infrared (NIR) RVs from CARMENES-NIR, CSHELL, IRD, iSHELL, NIRSPEC, and SPIRou, we provide a 5σ upper limit to the mass of AU Mic c of M c ≤ 20.13 M ⊕ and present a refined mass of AU Mic b of M b = 20.12 − 1.57 + 1.72 M ⊕ . Used in our analyses is a new RV modeling toolkit to exploit the wavelength dependence of stellar activity present in our RVs via wavelength-dependent Gaussian processes. By obtaining near-simultaneous visible and near-infrared RVs, we also compute the temporal evolution of RV “color” and introduce a regressional method to aid in isolating Keplerian from stellar activity signals when modeling RVs in future works. Using a multiwavelength Gaussian process model, we demonstrate the ability to recover injected planets at 5σ significance with semi-amplitudes down to ≈10 m s−1 with a known ephemeris, more than an order of magnitude below the stellar activity amplitude. However, we find that the accuracy of the recovered semi-amplitudes is ∼50% for such signals with our model.","astronomy"
"Secondary eclipse observations of several of the hottest hot Jupiters show featureless, blackbody-like spectra or molecular emission features, which are consistent with thermal inversions being present in those atmospheres. Theory predicts a transition between warmer atmospheres with thermal inversions and cooler atmospheres without inversions, but the exact transition point is unknown. In order to further investigate this issue, we observed two secondary eclipses of the hot Jupiter HAT-P-7b with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) WFC3 instrument and combined these data with previous Spitzer and Kepler secondary eclipse observations. The HST and Spitzer data can be well fit by a blackbody with T = 2692 ± 14 K, and the Kepler data point constrains the geometric albedo to A g = 0.077 ± 0.006. We modeled these data with a three-dimensional (3D) GCM and one-dimensional (1D) self-consistent forward models. The 1D models indicate that the atmosphere has a thermal inversion, weak heat redistribution, and water dissociation that limits the range of pressures probed. This result suggests that WFC3 observations of HAT-P-7b and possibly some other ultra-hot Jupiters appear blackbody-like because they probe a region near the tropopause where the atmospheric temperature changes slowly with pressure. Additionally, the 1D models constrain the atmospheric metallicity ( ) and the carbon-to-oxygen ratio (C/O &lt; 1 at 99% confidence). The solar composition 3D GCM matches the Spitzer data but generally underpredicts the flux in the WFC3 bandpass and cannot reproduce its featureless shape. This discrepancy could be explained by high atmospheric drag or nightside clouds and may be better understood through further observation with the James Webb Space Telescope.","astronomy"
"Although high-resolution spectra of the CN red-system band are considered useful in cometary sciences, e.g., in the study of isotopic ratios of carbon and nitrogen in cometary volatiles, there have been few reports to date due to the lack of high-resolution (R ≡ λ/Δλ &gt; 20,000) spectrographs in the near-infrared region around ∼1 μm. Here, we present the high-resolution emission spectrum of the CN red-system band in comet C/2013 R1 (Lovejoy), acquired by the near-infrared high-resolution spectrograph WINERED mounted on the 1.3 m Araki telescope at the Koyama Astronomical Observatory, Kyoto, Japan. We applied our fluorescence excitation models for CN, based on modern spectroscopic studies, to the observed spectrum of comet C/2013 R1 (Lovejoy) to search for CN isotopologues (13C14N and 12C15N). We used a CN fluorescence excitation model involving both a “pure” fluorescence excitation model for the outer coma and a “fully collisional” fluorescence excitation model for the inner coma region. Our emission model could reproduce the observed 12C14N red-system band of comet C/2013 R1 (Lovejoy). The derived mixing ratio between the two excitation models was 0.94(+0.02/−0.03):0.06(+0.03/−0.02), corresponding to the radius of the collision-dominant region of ∼800–1600 km from the nucleus. No isotopologues were detected. The observed spectrum is consistent, within error, with previous estimates in comets of 12C/13C (∼90) and 14N/15N (∼150).","astronomy"
"The Transit Ephemeris Refinement and Monitoring Survey is a project that aims to detect transits of intermediate-long period planets by refining orbital parameters of the known radial velocity planets using additional data from ground-based telescopes, calculating a revised transit ephemeris for the planet, then monitoring the planet host star during the predicted transit window. Here we present the results from three systems that had high probabilities of transiting planets: HD 9446 b and c, HD 43691 b, and HD 179079 b. We provide new radial velocity (RV) measurements that are then used to improve the orbital solution for the known planets. We search the RV data for indications of additional planets in orbit and find that HD 9446 shows a strong linear trend of 4.8σ. Using the newly refined planet orbital solutions, which include a new best-fit solution for the orbital period of HD 9446 c, and an improved transit ephemerides, we found no evidence of transiting planets in the photometry for each system. Transits of HD 9446 b can be ruled out completely and transits HD 9446 c and HD 43691 b can be ruled out for impact parameters up to b = 0.5778 and b = 0.898, respectively, due to gaps in the photometry. A transit of HD 179079 b cannot be ruled out, however, due to the relatively small size of this planet compared to the large star and thus low signal to noise. We determine properties of the three host stars through spectroscopic analysis and find through photometric analysis that HD 9446 exhibits periodic variability.","astronomy"
"Instrument models (IMs) enable the reduction of systematic error in transit spectroscopy light-curve data, but, since the model formulation can influence the estimation of science model parameters, characterization of the instrument model effects is crucial to the interpretation of the reduced data. We analyze a simple instrument model and assess its validity and performance across Hubble WFC3 and STIS instruments. Over a large, n = 63, sample of observed targets, a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler computes the parent distribution of each instrument model parameter. Possible parent distribution functions are then fit and tested against the empirical IM distribution. Correlation and other analyses are then performed to find IM relationships. The model is shown to perform well across the two instruments and three filters analyzed and, further, the Student’s t distribution is shown to closely fit the empirical parent distribution of IM parameters and the Gaussian distribution is shown to poorly model the observed distribution. This parent distribution can be used in the MCMC prior fitting and demonstrates IM consistency for wide-scale atmospheric analysis using this model. Finally, we propose a simple metric based on light-curve residuals to determine model performance, and we demonstrate its ability to determine whether a derived spectrum under this IM is high quality and robust.","astronomy"
"We have used the Habitable Zone Planet Finder (HPF) to gather high-resolution, high signal-to-noise near-infrared spectra of 13 field red horizontal branch (RHB) stars, one open cluster giant, and one very metal-poor halo red giant. The HPF spectra cover the 0.81–1.28 μm wavelength range of the zyJ bands, partially filling the gap between the optical (0.4–1.0 μm) and infrared (1.5–2.4 μm) spectra already available for the program stars. We derive abundances of 17 species from LTE-based computations involving equivalent widths and spectrum syntheses, and estimate abundance corrections for the species that are most affected by departures from LTE in RHB stars. Generally good agreement is found between HPF-based metallicities and abundance ratios and those from the optical and infrared spectral regions. Light element transitions dominate the HPF spectra of these red giants, and HPF data can be used to derive abundances from species with poor or no representation in optical spectra (e.g., C i, P i, S i, K i). Attention is drawn to the HPF abundances in two field solar-metallicity RHB stars of special interest: one with an extreme carbon isotope ratio, and one with a rare, very large lithium content. The latter star is unique in our sample in exhibiting very strong He i 10830 Å absorption. The abundances of the open cluster giant concur with those derived from other wavelength regions. Detections of C i and S i in HD 122563 are reported, yielding the lowest metallicity determination of [S/Fe] from more than one multiplet.","astronomy"
"We study the Lagrange stability in the spatial elliptic restricted three-body problem. In this study, we essentially use the boundedness of the motion of a small particle with respect to planar coordinates and show that this plays a key role in ensuring the boundedness of the motion in the spatial case. As a result, we obtain the Lagrange stability theorem for an infinitely small particle in the spatial elliptic restricted three-body problem. The proposed approach can then be extended to the case of the general three-body problem.","astronomy"
"We report on Cosmic Origin Spectrograph observations of the gamma-ray bright blazar B2 1215+30, collected in 2015 November. These observations allow for the confirmation of the source redshift from the detection of a Lyα emission feature at λ ∼ 1374 Å. The emission feature places the source at a redshift of z = 0.1305 ± 0.003, confirming the source’s ground-based spectral measurement. The gamma-ray emission of the source is discussed in the context of the source distance, required for the accurate reconstruction of the intrinsic gamma-ray emission taking the absorption by the extragalactic background light into account. The source distance is found to be low enough that the previously reported detection of an exceptional flaring event from B2 1215+30 in 2014 cannot be used to investigate opacity-specific spectral and variability characteristics introduced by possible ultra-high-energy cosmic-ray propagation.","astronomy"
"The Andromeda galaxy (M31) is an object of ongoing study with the Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) on AstroSat. Field 2, which is 6.4 kpc in diameter at the distance of M31, includes a substantial part of the NE spiral arms of the galaxy. We have obtained a second observation of Field 2 with the far-ultraviolet (FUV) F148W (148 nm) filter, separated from the first observation by 1465 days. Both observations are analyzed to detect sources that are variable at a &gt;3σ confidence level. For sources with less than ∼2″ separation, we apply multi-Gaussian fits, to obtain reliable magnitudes in the presence of source crowding. The variable sources are found to be concentrated in the spiral arms, with fraction of variable to nonvariable sources ∼2 times higher than for interarm regions, indicating an association of FUV variables with young stellar populations. UVIT FUV-NUV color–magnitude diagrams confirm the association of FUV variables with young massive/hot stars. Using existing catalogs, we obtain counterparts for 64 of the 82 most variable sources (&gt;5σ). The counterparts include 13 star clusters, three ionized hydrogen (H ii) regions, three novae, one S Doradus star, eight eclipsing binaries, 20 foreground sources, two regular variables, and 14 unspecified variables.","astronomy"
"We observed 15 of the solar-type binaries within 67 pc of the Sun previously observed by the Robo-AO system in the visible, with the PHARO near-infrared camera and the PALM-3000 adaptive optics system on the 5 m Hale telescope. The physical status of the binaries is confirmed through common proper motion and detection of orbital motion. In the process, we detected a new candidate companion to HIP 95309. We also resolved the primary of HIP 110626 into a close binary, making that system a triple. These detections increase the completeness of the multiplicity survey of the solar-type stars within 67 pc of the Sun. Combining our observations of HIP 103455 with archival astrometric measurements and RV measurements, we are able to compute the first orbit of HIP 103455, showing that the binary has a 68 year period. We place the components on a color–magnitude diagram and discuss each multiple system individually.","astronomy"
"We present results derived from four stellar occultations by the plutino object (208996) 2003 AZ84, detected on 2011 January 8 (single-chord event), 2012 February 3 (multi-chord), 2013 December 2 (single-chord), and 2014 November 15 (multi-chord). Our observations rule out an oblate spheroid solution for 2003 AZ84's shape. Instead, assuming hydrostatic equilibrium, we find that a Jacobi triaxial solution with semiaxes km can better account for all our occultation observations. Combining these dimensions with the rotation period of the body (6.75 hr) and the amplitude of its rotation light curve, we derive a density g cm−3, a geometric albedo . A grazing chord observed during the 2014 occultation reveals a topographic feature along 2003 AZ84's limb, which can be interpreted as an abrupt chasm of width ∼23 km and depth km, or a smooth depression of width ∼80 km and depth ∼13 km (or an intermediate feature between those two extremes).","astronomy"
"Haumea is one of the most interesting and intriguing trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs). It is a large, bright, fast rotator, and its spectrum indicates nearly pure water ice on the surface. It has at least two satellites and a dynamically related family of more than 10 TNOs with very similar proper orbital parameters and similar surface properties. The Haumean family is the only one currently known in the trans-Neptunian belt. Various models have been proposed, but the formation of the family remains poorly understood. In this work, we have investigated the rotational properties of the family members and unconfirmed family candidates with short-term variability studies, and report the most complete review to date. We present results based on five years of observations and report the short-term variability of five family members and seven candidates. The mean rotational periods, from Maxwellian fits to the frequency distributions, are 6.27 ± 1.19 hr for the confirmed family members, 6.44 ± 1.16 hr for the candidates, and 7.65 ± 0.54 hr for other TNOs (without relation to the family). According to our study, there is a possibility that Haumea family members rotate faster than other TNOs; however, the sample of family members is still too limited for a secure conclusion. We also highlight the fast rotation of 2002 GH32. This object has a 0.36 ± 0.02 mag amplitude lightcurve and a rotational period of about 3.98 hr. Assuming 2002 GH32 is a triaxial object in hydrostatic equilibrium, we derive a lower limit to the density of 2.56 g cm−3. This density is similar to Haumea’s and much more dense than other small TNO densities.","astronomy"
"New MMT/Hectospec spectroscopy centered on the galaxy cluster A2626 and covering a ∼1.8 deg2 area out to z ∼ 0.46 more than doubles the number of galaxy redshifts in this region. The spectra confirm four clusters previously identified photometrically. A2625, which was previously thought to be a close neighbor of A2626, is in fact much more distant. The new data show six substructures associated with A2626 and five more associated with A2637. There is also a highly collimated collection of galaxies and galaxy groups between A2626 and A2637 having at least three and probably four substructures. At larger scales, the A2626–A2637 complex is not connected to the Pegasus–Perseus filament.","astronomy"
"We present Spitzer full-orbit thermal phase curves of the hot Jupiter Qatar-1b, a planet with the same equilibrium temperature—and intermediate surface gravity and orbital period—as the well-studied planets HD 209458b and WASP-43b. We measure secondary eclipse depths of 0.21 ± 0.02% at 3.6 μm and 0.30 ± 0.02% at 4.5 μm, corresponding to dayside brightness temperatures of K and K, respectively, consistent with a vertically isothermal dayside. The respective nightside brightness temperatures are and K, in line with a trend that hot Jupiters all have similar nightside temperatures. We infer a Bond albedo of and a moderate day–night heat recirculation efficiency, similar to HD 209458b. General circulation models for HD 209458b and WASP-43b predict that their bright spots should be shifted east of the substellar point by tens of degrees, and these predictions were previously confirmed with Spitzer full-orbit phase curve observations. The phase curves of Qatar-1b are likewise expected to exhibit eastward offsets. Instead, the observed phase curves are consistent with no offset: 11° ± 7° at 3.6 μm and −4° ± 7° at 4.5 μm. The discrepancy in circulation patterns between these three otherwise similar planets points to the importance of secondary parameters like rotation rate and surface gravity, and the presence or absence of clouds, in determining atmospheric conditions on hot Jupiters.","astronomy"
"In 2014 February, the System for High contrast And coronography from R to K at VISual bands (SHARK-VIS) Forerunner, a high contrast experimental imager operating at visible wavelengths, was installed at the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT). Here we report on the first results obtained by recent on-sky tests. These results show the extremely good performance of the LBT Extreme Adaptive Optics (ExAO) system at visible wavelengths, both in terms of spatial resolution and contrast achieved. Similarly to what was done by Amara &amp; Quanz (2012), we used the SHARK-VIS Forerunner data to quantitatively assess the contrast enhancement. This is done by injecting several different synthetic faint objects in the acquired data and applying the angular differential imaging (ADI) technique. A contrast of the order of 5 × 10−5 is obtained at 630 nm for angular separations from the star larger than 100 mas. These results are discussed in light of the future development of SHARK-VIS and compared to those obtained by other high contrast imagers operating at similar wavelengths.","astronomy"
"We use several mathematical methods, such as the continuous wavelet transform, the wavelet coherence (WTC), and the partial wavelet coherence, to investigate the distribution and oscillation periods of the daily interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) intensity as well as the connection between IMF fluctuations and solar activity indices (the magnetic plage strength index and the Mount Wilson sunspot index). The daily IMF intensity generally approximately follows a log-normal distribution that is directly related to the distribution of the active region flux. The short-term periods of the IMF are about 13.7, 27.6, 37.1, and 75.3 days. They are driven by the quasi-periodicity of the magnetic surges on the solar surface. The medium-term periods of 1.07 and 1.82 years need to be derived from the stochastic interaction of local fields and meridional flows, since coronal holes reflect the transport of the magnetic flux on the solar surface and variations in the meridional flow are seen in the heliosphere. The 10.9-year period is the Schwabe solar cycle and is to be mentioned first. The solar cycle variation of the IMF is not thought to be related to weak solar magnetic activity, but is dominated by the strong solar magnetic field activity seen on the disk, because the footpoints of the time-varying component of the interplanetary magnetic flux are rooted in regions that are located near the sources of coronal mass ejections that are related to active regions, while the constant component in the IMF is thought to initially and mainly come from the weak solar magnetic field activity. Finally, the slow variation of the IMF indicates that it may have a period of longer than 50 years.","astronomy"
"Using a recently introduced synthetic method to compute the asteroid secular frequencies (Knezevic and Milani 2019), in this paper we survey the locations of secular resonances in the 9 dynamically distinct zones of the asteroid belt. Positions of all resonances up to order four, of a significant fraction of the order six resonances, and of a several order eight ones were determined, plotted in the space of proper elements, and discussed in relation to the local dynamics and to the structure and shape of the nearby asteroid collisional families. Only the resonant combinations with fundamental frequencies of Jupiter and Saturn were considered, with a few special cases involving other planets and largest asteroids. Accuracy of the polynomial fit to determine the frequencies was found to be satisfactory for the purpose of determination of secular resonance positions. This enabled a precise identification of dynamical mechanisms affecting the computation of frequencies (close vicinity of the mean motion resonances and libration in secular resonances), and of the ?cycle slips? as a primary technical drawback causing deterioration of the results. For each zone we also presented and discussed a fairly complete sample of recent works dealing with interaction of the secular resonances with asteroid families present in that zone. Finally, a few words were devoted to possibilities for future work.","astronomy"
"Titan’s atmospheric inventory of oxygen compounds (H2O, CO2, CO) are thought to result from photochemistry acting on externally supplied oxygen species (O+, OH, H2O). These species potentially originate from two main sources: (1) cryogenic plumes from the active moon Enceladus and (2) micrometeoroid ablation. Enceladus is already suspected to be the major O+ source, which is required for CO creation. However, photochemical models also require H2O and OH influx to reproduce observed quantities of CO2 and H2O. Here, we exploit sulphur as a tracer to investigate the oxygen source because it has very different relative abundances in micrometeorites (S/O ∼ 10−2) and Enceladus’ plumes (S/O ∼ 10−5). Photochemical models predict most sulphur is converted to CS in the upper atmosphere, so we use Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations at ∼340 GHz to search for CS emission. We determined stringent CS 3σ stratospheric upper limits of 0.0074 ppb (uniform above 100 km) and 0.0256 ppb (uniform above 200 km). These upper limits are not quite stringent enough to distinguish between Enceladus and micrometeorite sources at the 3σ level and a contribution from micrometeorites cannot be ruled out, especially if external flux is toward the lower end of current estimates. Only the high-flux micrometeorite source model of Hickson et al. can be rejected at 3σ. We determined a 3σ stratospheric upper limit for CH2NH of 0.35 ppb, which suggests cosmic rays may have a smaller influence in the lower stratosphere than predicted by some photochemical models. Disk-averaged C3H4 and C2H5CN profiles were determined and are consistent with previous ALMA and Cassini/CIRS measurements.","astronomy"
"We present a daytime thermal image of Europa taken with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array. The imaged region includes the area northwest of Pwyll Crater, which is associated with a nighttime thermal excess seen by the Galileo Photopolarimeter Radiometer and with two potential plume detections. We develop a global thermal model of Europa and simulate both the daytime and nighttime thermal emission to determine if the nighttime thermal anomaly is caused by excess endogenic heat flow, as might be expected from a plume source region. We find that the nighttime and daytime brightness temperatures near Pwyll Crater cannot be matched by including excess heat flow at that location. Rather, we can successfully model both measurements by increasing the local thermal inertia of the surface.","astronomy"
"We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations of the continuum and line emission of 12CO, 13CO, C18O, and [C i] for a portion of the G287.38-0.62 (Car 1-E) region in the Carina star-forming complex. The new data record how a molecular cloud responds on subarcsecond scales when subjected to a powerful radiation front, and provide insights into the overall process of star formation within regions that contain the most-massive young stars. The maps show several molecular clouds superpose upon the line of sight, including a portion of the Western Wall, a highly irradiated cloud situated near the young star cluster Trumpler 14. In agreement with theory, there is a clear progression from fluoresced H2, to [C i], to C18O with distance into the photodissociation region (PDR) front. Emission from optically thick 12CO extends across the region, while 13CO, [C i] and especially C18O are more optically thin, and concentrate into clumps and filaments closer to the PDR interface. Within the Western Wall cloud itself we identify 254 distinct core-sized clumps in our data cube of C18O. The mass distribution of these objects is similar to that of the stellar initial mass function. Aside from a large-scale velocity gradient, the clump radial velocities lack any spatial coherence size. There is no direct evidence for triggering of star formation in the Western Wall in that its C18O clumps and continuum cores appear starless, with no pillars present. However, the densest portion of the cloud lies closest to the PDR, and the C18O emission is flattened along the radiation front.","astronomy"
"We present results from deep H i and optical imaging of AGC 229101, an unusual H i source detected at v helio =7116 km s−1 in the Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA (ALFALFA) blind H i survey. Initially classified as a candidate “dark” source because it lacks a clear optical counterpart in Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) or Digitized Sky Survey 2 (DSS2) imaging, AGC 229101 has 109.31±0.05 M ⊙ of H i, but an H i line width of only 43 ± 9 km s−1. Low-resolution Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT) imaging and higher-resolution Very Large Array (VLA) B-array imaging show that the source is significantly elongated, stretching over a projected length of ∼80 kpc. The H i imaging resolves the source into two parts of roughly equal mass. WIYN partially populated One Degree Imager (pODI) optical imaging reveals a faint, blue optical counterpart coincident with the northern portion of the H i. The peak surface brightness of the optical source is only μ g ∼ 26.6 mag arcsec−2, well below the typical cutoff that defines the isophotal edge of a galaxy, and its estimated stellar mass is only 107.32±0.33 M ⊙, yielding an overall neutral gas-to-stellar mass ratio of M/M * = 98 − 52 + 111 . We demonstrate the extreme nature of this object by comparing its properties with those of other H i-rich sources in ALFALFA and the literature. We also explore potential scenarios that might explain the existence of AGC 229101, including a tidal encounter with neighboring objects and a merger of two dark H i clouds.","astronomy"
"Environmental and instrumental conditions can cause anomalies in astronomical images, which can potentially bias all kinds of measurements if not excluded. Detection of the anomalous images is usually done by human eyes, which is slow and sometimes not accurate. This is an important issue in weak lensing studies, particularly in the era of large-scale galaxy surveys, in which image qualities are crucial for the success of galaxy shape measurements. In this work we present two automatic methods for detecting anomalous images in astronomical data sets. The anomalous features can be divided into two types: one is associated with the source images, and the other appears on the background. Our first method, called the entropy method, utilizes the randomness of the orientation distribution of the source shapes and the background gradients to quantify the likelihood of an exposure being anomalous. Our second method involves training a neural network (autoencoder) to detect anomalies. We evaluate the effectiveness of the entropy method on the Canada–France–Hawaii Telescope Lensing Survey (CFHTLenS) and Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey (DECaLS DR3) data. In CFHTLenS, with 1171 exposures, the entropy method outperforms human inspection by detecting 12 of the 13 anomalous exposures found during human inspection and uncovering 10 new ones. In DECaLS DR3, with 17112 exposures, the entropy method detects a significant number of anomalous exposures while keeping a low false-positive rate. We find that although the neural network performs relatively well in detecting source anomalies, its current performance is not as good as the entropy method.","astronomy"
"The bulge is the oldest component of the Milky Way. Since numerous simulations of Milky Way formation have predicted that the oldest stars at a given metallicity are found on tightly bound orbits, the Galaxy’s oldest stars are likely metal-poor stars in the inner bulge with small apocenters (i.e., R apo ≲ 4 kpc). In the past, stars with these properties have been impossible to find due to extreme reddening and extinction along the line of sight to the inner bulge. We have used the mid-infrared metal-poor star selection of Schlaufman &amp; Casey (2014) on Spitzer/Galactic Legacy Infrared Mid-Plane Survey Extraordinaire data to overcome these problems and target candidate inner bulge metal-poor giants for moderate-resolution spectroscopy with Anglo-Australian Telescope/AAOmega. We used those data to select three confirmed metal-poor giants ([Fe/H] = −3.15, −2.56, −2.03) for follow-up high-resolution Magellan/Magellan Inamori Kyocera Echelle spectroscopy. A comprehensive orbit analysis using Gaia DR2 astrometry and our measured radial velocities confirms that these stars are tightly bound inner bulge stars. We determine the elemental abundances of each star and find high titanium and iron-peak abundances relative to iron in our most metal-poor star. We propose that the distinct abundance signature we detect is a product of nucleosynthesis in the Chandrasekhar-mass thermonuclear supernova of a CO white dwarf accreting from a helium star with a delay time of about 10 Myr. Even though chemical evolution is expected to occur quickly in the bulge, the intense star formation in the core of the nascent Milky Way was apparently able to produce at least one Chandrasekhar-mass thermonuclear supernova progenitor before chemical evolution advanced beyond .","astronomy"
"The gravitational microlensing technique is most sensitive to planets in a Jupiter-like orbit and has detected more than 200 planets. However, only a few wide-orbit (s &gt; 2) microlensing planets have been discovered, where s is the planet-to-host separation normalized to the angular Einstein ring radius, θ E. Here, we present the discovery and analysis of a strong candidate wide-orbit microlensing planet in the event OGLE-2017-BLG-0448. The whole light curve exhibits long-term residuals to the static binary-lens single-source model, so we investigate the residuals by adding the microlensing parallax, microlensing xallarap, an additional lens, or an additional source. For the first time, we observe a complex degeneracy between all four effects. The wide-orbit models with s ∼ 2.5 and a planet-to-host mass ratio of q ∼ 10−4 are significantly preferred, but we cannot rule out the close models with s ∼ 0.35 and q ∼ 10−3. A Bayesian analysis based on a Galactic model indicates that, despite the complicated degeneracy, the surviving wide-orbit models all contain a super-Earth-mass to Neptune-mass planet at a projected planet-host separation of ∼6 au and the surviving close-orbit models all consist of a Jovian-mass planet at ∼1 au. The host star is probably an M or K dwarf. We discuss the implications of this dimension-degeneracy disaster on microlensing light-curve analysis and its potential impact on statistical studies.","astronomy"
"We report a discovery of a z = 4.72 radio galaxy, HSC J083913.17+011308.1, using the Lyman break technique with the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Survey (HSC-SSP) catalog for Very Large Array Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty centimeter radio sources. The number of known high-z radio galaxies (HzRGs) at z &gt; 3 is quite small to constrain the evolution of HzRGs so far. The deep and wide-area optical survey by HSC-SSP enables us to apply the Lyman break technique to a large search for HzRGs. For an HzRG candidate among pre-selected r-band dropouts with a radio detection, a follow-up optical spectroscopy with the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrographs (GMOS)/Gemini has been performed. The obtained spectrum presents a clear Lyα emission line redshifted to z = 4.72. The spectral energy distribution fitting analysis with the rest-frame UV and optical photometries suggests the massive nature of this HzRG with . The small equivalent width of Lyα and the moderately red UV colors indicate its dusty host galaxy, implying a chemically evolved and dusty system. The radio spectral index does not meet a criterion for an ultra-steep spectrum, of −1.1 and of −0.9, demonstrating that the HSC-SSP survey compensates for a subpopulation of HzRGs that are missed in surveys focusing on an ultra-steep spectral index.","astronomy"
"We report trigonometric parallax and proper motion measurements of 6.7 GHz CH3OH and 22 GHz H2O masers in eight high-mass star-forming regions (HMSFRs) based on Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) observations as part of the Bar and Spiral Structure Legacy (BeSSeL) Survey. The distances of these HMSFRs combined with their Galactic coordinates, radial velocities, and proper motions, allow us to assign them to a segment of the Perseus arm with ℓ ≲ 70°. These HMSFRs are clustered in Galactic longitude from ≈30° to ≈50° neighboring a dearth of such sources between longitudes ≈50° to ≈90°.","astronomy"
"We present a catalog of ∼100,000 periodic variable stars in Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) full-frame image data among members of widely distributed moving groups identified with Gaia in the previous papers in the series. By combining the periods from our catalog attributable to rotation with previously derived rotation periods for benchmark open clusters, we develop an empirical gyrochronology relation of angular momentum evolution that is valid for stars with ages 10–1000 Myr. Excluding stars rotating faster than 2 days, which we find are predominantly binaries, we achieve a typical age precision of ≈0.2–0.3 dex and improving at older ages. Importantly, these empirical relations apply to not only FGK-type stars but also M-type stars, due to the angular momentum distribution being much smoother, simpler, continuous, and monotonic as compared to the rotation period distribution. As a result, we are also able to begin tracing in fine detail the nature of angular momentum loss in low-mass stars as functions of mass and age. We characterize the stellar variability amplitudes of the cool stars as functions of mass and age, which may correlate with the starspot covering fractions. We also identify pulsating variables among the hotter stars in the catalog, including δ Scuti, γ Dor, and slowly pulsating B-type variables. These data represent an important step forward in being able to estimate precise ages of FGK- and M-type stars in the field, starting as early as the pre-main-sequence phase of evolution.","astronomy"
"The Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) survey is currently acquiring integral-field spectroscopy for the largest sample of galaxies to date. By 2020, the MaNGA Survey—which is one of three core programs in the fourth-generation Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-IV)—will have observed a statistically representative sample of 104 galaxies in the local universe (z ≲ 0.15). In addition to a robust data-reduction pipeline (DRP), MaNGA has developed a data-analysis pipeline (DAP) that provides higher-level data products. To accompany the first public release of its code base and data products, we provide an overview of the MaNGA DAP, including its software design, workflow, measurement procedures and algorithms, performance, and output data model. In conjunction with our companion paper (Belfiore et al.), we also assess the DAP output provided for 4718 observations of 4648 unique galaxies in the recent SDSS Data Release 15 (DR15). These analysis products focus on measurements that are close to the data and require minimal model-based assumptions. Namely, we provide stellar kinematics (velocity and velocity dispersion), emission-line properties (kinematics, fluxes, and equivalent widths), and spectral indices (e.g., D4000 and the Lick indices). We find that the DAP provides robust measurements and errors for the vast majority (&gt;99%) of analyzed spectra. We summarize assessments of the precision and accuracy of our measurements as a function of signal-to-noise. We also provide specific guidance to users regarding the limitations of the data. The MaNGA DAP software is publicly available and we encourage community involvement in its development.","astronomy"
"The Mission Accessible Near-Earth Objects Survey aims to physically characterize sub-km near-Earth objects (NEOs). We report the first photometric results from the survey that began in 2013 August. Photometric observations were performed using 1–4 m class telescopes around the world. We present rotational periods and light curve amplitudes for 86 sub-km NEOs, though in some cases only lower limits are provided. Our main goal is to obtain light curves for small NEOs (typically, sub-km objects) and estimate their rotational periods, light curve amplitudes, and shapes. These properties are used for a statistical study to constrain overall properties of the NEO population. A weak correlation seems to indicate that smaller objects are more spherical than larger ones. We also report seven NEOs that are fully characterized (light curve and visible spectra) as the most suitable candidates for a future human or robotic mission. Viable mission targets are objects fully characterized, with Δv NHATS ≤ 12 km s−1, and a rotational period P &gt; 1 hr. Assuming a similar rate of object characterization as reported in this paper, approximately 1230 NEOs need to be characterized in order to find 100 viable mission targets.","astronomy"
"More than a decade elapsed after the HIPPARCOS ESA mission (ESA 1997) observations have been collected. This first astronomical satellite mission was less than 4 years long so that 1991.25 is the epoch of the HIPPARCOS Catalogue. Many other projects have checked or improved HIPPARCOS data. Also, a long series of ground - based optical observations of some stars included in HIPPARCOS Catalogue, made with Photographic Zenith Tubes (PZT) are useful for the task of improving the proper motions of these stars. The ARIHIP Catalogue (after ACT, TYCHO - 2, FK6, GC+HIP, TYC2+HIP) is a combination of the HIPPARCOS and some ground - based data, and the ARIHIP proper motions are more accurate than the HIPPARCOS ones. Here we present a new step of our procedure of calculation; between PZT data we added the HIPPARCOS position with suitable weight - the point with the coordinates (1991:25, 0 . 00 0) in our case. The method was applied to 202 stars observed at Richmond PZTs in the course of a few decades. The result is better proper motions in declination for these HIPPARCOS stars, and a good agreement with ARIHIP proper motions (we found 128 common Richmond and ARIHIP stars to check our result). Also, we present the result for other 74 Richmond stars which are not found in ARIHIP.","astronomy"
"We conducted a variable star search on the metal-rich Galactic globular cluster NGC 6652 using archival Gemini-S/Gemini Multiobject Spectrograph data. We report the discovery of nine new variable stars in the NGC 6652 field, of which we classify six as eclipsing binaries and one as an SX Phoenicis star, leaving two variables without classification. Using proper motions from Gaia DR2 and Hubble Space Telescope, albeit with some uncertainties, we find that the cluster, the field, and the background Sagittarius stream each have three of these variables. We also reassess the membership of known variables based on the Gaia proper motions, confirming the existence of one RR Lyrae star in the cluster.","astronomy"
"We present an analytic description of tides raised on a star by a small orbiting body. In particular, we highlight the disproportionate effect of eccentricity and thus the scope for using these tides to detect and characterize the orbits of exoplanets and brown dwarfs. The tidal distortions of the star produced by an eccentric orbit are, in comparison to a circular orbit, much richer in detail and potentially visible from any viewing angle. The magnitude of these variations is much larger than that in a circular orbit of the same semimajor axis. These variations are visible in both photometric and spectroscopic data and dominate other regular sources of phase variability (e.g., reflection and Doppler beaming) over a particularly interesting portion of parameter space. These tidal signatures will be a useful tool for planet detection on their own and, used in concert with other methods, provide powerful constraints on planetary and stellar properties.","astronomy"
"We present a python package, called Nifty4Gemini, and its associated Pyraf/Python based pipeline for processing Gemini-North Near-Infrared Integral Field Spectrometer (NIFS) observations. Built on the Gemini IRAF package’s capabilities, Nifty4Gemini's associated NIFS pipeline is a data reduction package which reduces NIFS raw data and produces a flux and wavelength calibrate science cube with the full signal-to-noise ratio, ready for science analysis. It utilizes tasks from the Gemini IRAF package, PyRAF, and packages from the Gemini AstroConda environment. Nifty4Gemini is a configuration-based pipeline framework written in python which is easily extensible to integrate additional pipelines and user-defined scripts.

"Future direct imaging missions similar to the HabEx and LUVOIR mission concepts aim to catalog and characterize Earth-mass analogs around nearby stars. The exoplanet yield of these missions will be dependent on the frequency of Earth-like planets, and potentially the a priori knowledge of which stars specifically host suitable planetary systems. Ground- or space-based radial velocity surveys can potentially perform the pre-selection of targets and assist in the optimization of observation times, as opposed to an uninformed direct imaging survey. In this paper, we present our framework for simulating future radial velocity surveys of nearby stars in support of direct imaging missions. We generate lists of exposure times, observation time-series, and radial velocity time-series given a direct imaging target list. We generate simulated surveys for a proposed set of telescopes and precise radial velocity spectrographs spanning a set of plausible global-network architectures that may be considered for next-generation extremely precise radial velocity surveys. We also develop figures of merit for observation frequency and planet detection sensitivity, and compare these across architectures. From these, we draw conclusions, given our stated assumptions and caveats, to optimize the yield of future radial velocity surveys supporting direct imaging missions. We find that all of our considered surveys obtain sufficient numbers of precise observations to meet the minimum theoretical white noise detection sensitivity for Earth-mass habitable-zone planets. While our detection rates and mass-sensitivity are optimistic, we have margin to explore systematic effects due to stellar activity and correlated noise in future work.","astronomy"
"We discuss the feasibility of and present initial designs and approximate cost estimates for a large (N ∼ 2000) network of small photometric telescopes that is purpose-built to monitor V ≲ 15 Gaia mission program stars for occultations by minor solar system bodies. The implementation of this network would permit measurement of the solar system’s tidal gravity field to high precision, thereby revealing the existence of distant trans-Neptunian objects such as the proposed “Planet Nine.” As a detailed example of the network capabilities, we investigate how occultations by Jovian Trojans can be monitored to track the accumulation of gravitational perturbations, thereby constraining the presence of undetected massive solar system bodies. We also show that the tidal influence of Planet Nine can be discerned from that of smaller, nearer objects in the Kuiper Belt. Moreover, ephemerides for all small solar system bodies observed in occultation could be significantly improved using this network, thereby improving spacecraft navigation and refining solar system modeling. Finally, occultation monitoring would generate direct measurements of size distributions for asteroid populations, permitting a better understanding of their origins.","astronomy"
"Spatiotemporal techniques for signal coordination with actively transmitting extraterrestrial civilizations, without the need for prior communication, can constrain technosignature searches to a significantly smaller coordinate space. With the variable star catalog from Gaia Data Release 3, we explore two related signaling strategies: the SETI Ellipsoid, and that proposed by Seto, which are both based on the synchronization of transmissions with a conspicuous astrophysical event. This data set contains more than 10 million variable star candidates with light curves from the first three years of Gaia’s operational phase, between 2014 and 2017. Using four different historical supernovae as source events, we find that less than 0.01% of stars in the sample have crossing times, the times at which we would expect to receive synchronized signals on Earth, within the date range of available Gaia observations. For these stars, we present a framework for technosignature analysis that searches for modulations in the variability parameters by splitting the stellar light curve at the crossing time.","astronomy"

The maps have resolutions of 3000 and 2000 and r.m.s., noise of 0.7 and 0.8 mJy/beam at 6 and 3 cm, respectively. These maps will be used for future studies of the SMC's radio source population and overall extended structure.","astronomy"
"We investigated the compliance of 43 commercially available solar filters (eclipse glasses) with the ISO 12312-2:2015 standard by measuring their spectral transmittances (280–2000 nm) and calculating their luminous, solar ultraviolet A, ultraviolet B, and infrared (IR) transmittances. We also evaluated the filters for usability by observing the full midday Sun and rating the view on a seven-point balanced scale, from “far too dark, details seen only with great difficulty” to “far too light, uncomfortable to view the Sun.” The mean ratings of two observers, one experienced and one inexperienced in solar observing, differed by 0.28 (95% confidence interval of the mean = 0.26). The inexperienced observer tended to be less accepting of high transmittances. All 43 solar filters complied with the UV and IR requirements. Eighteen filters passed the luminous transmittance requirements, and 24 were borderline too light or too dark. Seven of the 15 solar filters with a luminous transmittance darker than the requirement were rated as acceptable. One filter that passed and another that was borderline too light were rated as too light or far too light. The ISO 12312-2 limits derive from welding filter standards and do not represent an appropriate evidence base for direct solar viewing. This work provides the evidence base for a maximum 0.0012% and a minimum 0.00004% luminous transmittance for solar filters. The results of this study also support the use of welding filters between shades 12 and 16. Lighter welding filters are more acceptable than solar filters of the same luminous transmittance.","astronomy"
"Photometric measurements of the light and color variations of 39 semiregular variable stars over a 30 yr time interval have been used to explore the systematics of these variations. These results show the complex nature of the frequency compositions of the light curves of these stars. The frequencies present in the light curves tend to be harmonic in nature, suggesting that both modes of pulsation and shape effects may be involved and the nature of the variations indicates that stochastic excitation is involved.","astronomy"
"We report here on our search for excess power in photometry of Neptune collected by the K2 mission that may be due to intrinsic global oscillations of the planet Neptune. To conduct this search, we developed new methods to correct for instrumental effects such as intrapixel variability and gain variations. We then extracted and analyzed the time-series photometry of Neptune from 49 days of nearly continuous broadband photometry of the planet. We find no evidence of global oscillations and place an upper limit of ∼5 ppm at 1000 for the detection of a coherent signal. With an observed cadence of 1 minute and a point-to-point scatter of less than 0.01%, the photometric signal is dominated by reflected light from the Sun, which is in turn modulated by atmospheric variability of Neptune at the 2% level. A change in flux is also observed due to the increasing distance between Neptune and the K2 spacecraft and the solar variability with convection-driven solar p modes present.","astronomy"
"For future human missions to Mars, it is important to study the surface radiation environment during extreme and elevated conditions. In the long term, it is mainly galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) modulated by solar activity that contribute to the radiation on the surface of Mars, but intense solar energetic particle (SEP) events may induce acute health effects. Such events may enhance the radiation level significantly and should be detected as immediately as possible to prevent severe damage to humans and equipment. However, the energetic particle environment on the Martian surface is significantly different from that in deep space due to the influence of the Martian atmosphere. Depending on the intensity and shape of the original solar particle spectra, as well as particle types, the surface spectra may induce entirely different radiation effects. In order to give immediate and accurate alerts while avoiding unnecessary ones, it is important to model and well understand the atmospheric effect on the incoming SEPs, including both protons and helium ions. In this paper, we have developed a generalized approach to quickly model the surface response of any given incoming proton/helium ion spectra and have applied it to a set of historical large solar events, thus providing insights into the possible variety of surface radiation environments that may be induced during SEP events. Based on the statistical study of more than 30 significant solar events, we have obtained an empirical model for estimating the surface dose rate directly from the intensities of a power-law SEP spectra.","astronomy"
"We describe two new open-source tools written in Python for performing extreme deconvolution Gaussian mixture modeling (XDGMM) and using a conditioned model to re-sample observed supernova and host galaxy populations. XDGMM is new program that uses Gaussian mixtures to perform density estimation of noisy data using extreme deconvolution (XD) algorithms. Additionally, it has functionality not available in other XD tools. It allows the user to select between the AstroML and Bovy et al. fitting methods and is compatible with scikit-learn machine learning algorithms. Most crucially, it allows the user to condition a model based on the known values of a subset of parameters. This gives the user the ability to produce a tool that can predict unknown parameters based on a model that is conditioned on known values of other parameters. EmpiriciSN is an exemplary application of this functionality, which can be used to fit an XDGMM model to observed supernova/host data sets and predict likely supernova parameters using a model conditioned on observed host properties. It is primarily intended to simulate realistic supernovae for LSST data simulations based on empirical galaxy properties.","astronomy"
"The aim of this paper is to present results of analytical calculation of chemical potential of a Lennard Jones (LJ) fluid performed in two ways: by using the thermodynamical formalism and the formalism of statistical mechanics. The integration range is divided into two regions. In the small distance region, which is r ? ? in the usual notation, the integration range had to be cut off in order to avoid the occurrence of divergences. In the large distance region, the calculation is technically simpler. The calculation reported here will be useful in all kinds of studies concerning phase equilibrium in a LJ fluid. Interesting kinds of such systems are the giant planets and the icy satellites in various planetary systems, but also the (so far) hypothetical quark stars.","astronomy"
"We present the radio detection of 18 BL Lac objects from our survey of over 575 deg2 of sky. These 18 objects are located within 20'' of the X-ray position, of which 11 have a measured red-shift. All candidates are radio emitters above ~1 mJy and fall within the range of existing samples on the two colour, ?RO vs ?OX, diagram with a transitional population of three evident. Two unusual sources have been identified, a candidate radio quiet BL Lac, RX J0140.9-4130, and an extreme HBL, RX J0109.9-4020, with log (?peak) ?19:2. The BL Lac log(N)-log(S) relation is consistent with other samples and indicates the ROSAT All Sky Survey (RASS) could contain (2000?400) BL Lac objects.","astronomy"

Our search for resident supernova remnants (identified as sources with enhanced [SII] emission relative to their H? emission) in this galaxy yielded no sources of this kind, besides M&amp;H 10-11 or HoIX X-1. Nevertheless, we found a number of objects with significant H? emission that probably represent uncatalogued HII regions.","astronomy"

The plasma polymerized hydrocarbon nanoparticles were already proposed as a new astro analogue, which describe the infrared (IR) extinction spectra in an excellent way.

"Attenuation curves (laws) in the optical part of the spectrum (from about 3500 A to 9000 A) are determined for galaxies with different star formation histories (SFHs) using images in five photometrical bands from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Owing to large surveys like SDSS, it is possible to define several subgroups of galaxies with similar SFHs using two spectral indices that trace SFH. Attenuation curves are analyzed in terms of SFH and compared to the curves that are often used for dust correction of the observed data. .","astronomy"
"We estimate the stellar mass for a sample of low surface brightness galaxies (LSBGs) by fitting their multiband spectral energy distributions (SEDs) to the stellar population synthesis model. The derived stellar masses (log M */M ⊙) span from 7.1 to 11.1, with a mean of log M */M ⊙ = 8.5, which is lower than that for normal galaxies. The stellar mass-to-light ratio (γ*) in each band varies little with the absolute magnitude but increases with higher M *. This trend of γ* with M * is even stronger in bluer bands. In addition, the γ* for our LSBGs slightly declines from the r band to the longer-wavelength bands. The log (j = g, r, i, and z) have relatively tight relations with optical colors of g − r and g − i. Compared with several representative γ*–color relations (MLCRs) from the literature, our MLCRs based on LSBG data are consistently among those literature MLCRs previously defined on diverse galaxy samples, and the existing minor differences between the MLCRs are caused by the differences in the SED model ingredients (including initial mass function, star formation history, and stellar population model), line fitting techniques, galaxy samples, and photometric zero-point, rather than the galaxy surface brightness itself, which distinguishes LSBGs from high surface brightness galaxies. Our LSBGs would be very likely to follow those representative MLCRs previously defined in diverse galaxy populations, if those main ingredients were taken into account.","astronomy"
"The persistence of planetary systems after their host stars evolve into their post-main-sequence phase is poorly constrained by observations. Many young white dwarf systems exhibit infrared excess emission and/or spectral absorption lines associated with a reservoir of dust (or planetesimals) and its accretion. However, most white dwarfs are too cool to sufficiently heat any circumstellar dust to detectable levels of emission. The Helix Nebula (NGC 7293) is a young, nearby planetary nebula; observations at mid- and far-infrared wavelengths have revealed excess emission associated with its central white dwarf (WD 2226-210). The origin of this excess is ambiguous. It could be a remnant planetesimal belt, a cloud of comets, or the remnants of material shed during the post-asymptotic giant branch (post-AGB) phase. Here we combine infrared (Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy, Spitzer, Herschel) and millimeter (Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array) observations of the system to determine the origin of this excess using multiwavelength imaging and radiative transfer modeling. We find the data are incompatible with a compact remnant planetesimal belt or post-AGB disk, and conclude the dust most likely originates from deposition by a cometary cloud. The measured dust mass, and lifetime of the constituent grains, implies disruption of several thousand Hale–Bopp equivalent comets per year to fuel the observed excess emission around the Helix Nebula’s white dwarf.","astronomy"
"Young and dynamically active planetary systems can form disks of debris that are easier to image than the planets themselves. The morphology and evolution of these disks can help to infer the properties of the putative planets responsible for generating and shaping the debris structures. We present integral field spectroscopy and dual-band imaging from VLT/SPHERE (1.0–1.7 μm) of the debris disk around the young F2V/F3V star HD 115600. We aim to (1) characterize the geometry and composition of the debris ring, (2) search for thermal emission of young giant planets, and (3) in the absence of detected planets, to refine the inferred properties of plausible planets around HD 115600 to prepare future attempts to detect them. Using a different dust scattering model (ZODIPIC) than in the discovery paper to model the disk geometry, we find a 0 = 46 ± 2 au for the disk’s central radius and offsets Δα, Δδ = −1.0 ± 0.5, 0.5 ± 0.5 au. This offset is smaller than previously found, suggesting that unseen planets of lower masses could be sculpting the disk. Spectroscopy of the disk in Y-J bands with SPHERE shows reddish color, which becomes neutral or slightly blue in H-band seen with GPI, broadly consistent with a mixed bulk disk composition of processed organics and water ice. While our observed field contains numerous background objects at wide separations, no exoplanet has been directly observed to a mass sensitivity limit of 2 − 3(5 − 7) M J between a projected separation of 40 and 200 au for hot (cold)-start models.","astronomy"
"Transiting hot Jupiters present a unique opportunity to measure absolute planetary masses due to the magnitude of their radial velocity signals and known orbital inclination. Measuring planet mass is critical to understanding atmospheric dynamics and escape under extreme stellar irradiation. Here we present the ultrahot Jupiter system KELT-9 as a double-lined spectroscopic binary. This allows us to directly and empirically constrain the mass of the star and its planetary companion without reference to any theoretical stellar evolutionary models or empirical stellar scaling relations. Using data from the PEPSI, HARPS-N, and TRES spectrographs across multiple epochs, we apply least-squares deconvolution to measure out-of-transit stellar radial velocities. With the PEPSI and HARPS-N data sets, we measure in-transit planet radial velocities using transmission spectroscopy. By fitting the circular orbital solution that captures these Keplerian motions, we recover a planetary dynamical mass of 2.17 ± 0.56 M J and stellar dynamical mass of 2.11 ± 0.78 M ⊙, both of which agree with the discovery paper. Furthermore, we argue that this system, as well as systems like it, are highly overconstrained, providing multiple independent avenues for empirically cross-validating model-independent solutions to the system parameters. We also discuss the implications of this revised mass for studies of atmospheric escape.","astronomy"
"Modern spectroscopic surveys of galaxies such as MaNGA consist of millions of diverse spectra covering different regions of thousands of galaxies. We propose and implement a deep unsupervised machine-learning method to summarize the entire diversity of MaNGA spectra onto a 15 × 15 map (DESOM-1), where neighboring points on the map represent similar spectra. We demonstrate our method as an alternative to conventional full spectral fitting for deriving physical quantities and full probability distributions much more efficiently than traditional resource-intensive Bayesian methods. Since spectra are grouped by similarity, the distribution of spectra onto the map for a single galaxy, i.e., its “fingerprint,” reveals the presence of distinct stellar populations within the galaxy, indicating smoother or episodic star formation histories. We further map the diversity of galaxy fingerprints onto a second map (DESOM-2). Using galaxy images and independent measures of galaxy morphology, we confirm that galaxies with similar fingerprints have similar morphologies and inclination angles. Since morphological information was not used in the mapping algorithm, relating galaxy morphology to the star formation histories encoded in the fingerprints is one example of how the DESOM maps can be used to make scientific inferences.","astronomy"
"It has recently been suggested in this journal by Benford that “Lurkers” in the form of interstellar exploration probes could be present in the solar system. Similarly, extraterrestrial intelligence could send long-lived probes to many other stellar systems to report back science and surveillance. If probes and planets with technological species exist in more than a handful of systems in our Galaxy, it is beneficial to use a coordinated communication scheme. Due to the inverse square law, data rates decrease strongly for direct connections over long distances. The network bandwidth could be increased by orders of magnitude if repeater stations (nodes) are used in an optimized fashion. This introduction to a series of papers makes the assumptions of the communication scheme explicit. Subsequent papers will discuss technical aspects such as transmitters, repeaters, wavelengths, and power levels. The overall purpose is to gain insight into the physical characteristics of an interstellar communication network, allowing us to describe the most likely sizes and locations of nodes and probes.","astronomy"
"In order to assess the multiplicity statistics of stars across spectral types and populations in a volume-limited sample, we censused nearby stars for companions with Robo-AO. We report on observations of 1157 stars of all spectral types within 25 pc with decl. &gt;−13° searching for tight companions. We detected 154 companion candidates with separations ranging from ∼0.″15 to 4.″0 and magnitude differences up to Δm i ′ ≤ 7 using the robotic adaptive optics instrument Robo-AO. We confirmed physical association from Gaia EDR3 astrometry for 53 of the companion candidates, 99 remain to be confirmed, and two were ruled out as background objects. We complemented the high-resolution imaging companion search with a search for comoving objects with separations out to 10,000 au in Gaia EDR3, which resulted in an additional 147 companions registered. Of the 301 total companions reported in this study, 49 of them are new discoveries. Out of the 191 stars with significant acceleration measurements in the Hipparcos–Gaia catalog of accelerations, we detect companions around 115 of them, with the significance of the acceleration increasing as the companion separation decreases. From this survey, we report the following multiplicity fractions (compared to literature values): 40.9% ± 3.0% (44%) for FGK stars and 28.2% ± 2.3% (27%) for M stars, as well as higher-order fractions of 5.5% ± 1.1% (11%) and 3.9% ± 0.9% (5%) for FGK stars and M-type stars, respectively.","astronomy"
"We observed comet 96P/Machholz 1 on a total of nine nights before and after perihelion during its 2017/2018 apparition. Both its unusually small perihelion distance and the observed fragmentation during multiple apparitions make 96P an object of great interest. Our observations show no evidence of a detectable dust coma, implying that we are observing a bare nucleus at distances ranging from 2.3 to 3.8 au. Based on this assumption, we calculated its color and found average values of g′–r′ = 0.50 ± 0.04, r′–i′ = 0.17 ± 0.03, and i′–z′ = 0.06 ± 0.04. These are notably more blue than those of the nuclei of other Jupiter-family and long-period comets. Furthermore, assuming a bare nucleus, we found an equivalent nuclear radius of 3.4 ± 0.2 km with an axial ratio of at least 1.6 ± 0.1. The lightcurve clearly displays one large peak, one broad flat peak, and two distinct troughs, with a clear asymmetry that suggests that the shape of the nucleus deviates from that of a simple triaxial ellipsoid. This asymmetry in the lightcurve allowed us to constrain the nuclear rotation period to 4.10 ± 0.03 hr and 4.096 ± 0.002 hr before and after perihelion, respectively. Within the uncertainties, 96P’s rotation period does not appear to have changed throughout the apparition, and we conclude a maximum possible change in rotation period of 130 s. The observed properties were compared to those of comet 322P and interstellar object 1I/‘Oumuamua in an attempt to study the effects of close perihelion passages on cometary surfaces and their internal structure and the potential interstellar origin of 96P.","astronomy"
"Observations of an occultation of the UCAC4 488-082551 star by asteroid (76228) 2000 EH 75 were carried out on 31 May 2022 at Kryzhanivka observation station of Odesa I. I. Mechnykov National University (the observatory code A85). A set of instruments, which included a Schmidt telescope (the primary mirror diameter D = 271.25 mm; the corrector plate diameter D k = 223.9 mm; the focal length F = 440 mm), a GPS receiver and Videoscan-415-2001 CCD camera, was used to perform observations. The observing conditions were as follows: clear sky, the star’s altitude 49 0 south, the Moon was below the local horizon. The target star from the UCAC4 catalogue (Zacharias et al. 2013) has the following photometric parameters: m B = 14.008; m V = 12.720; m r = 12.284; m i = 11.813. The diameter of the star has not been determined. Asteroid (76228) is a Main Belt asteroid with an orbital period of 4.17178 years. It has an absolute magnitude of 14.93, the visible geometric albedo of 0.123±0.013 and diameter of 5.00±0.23 km (Masiero et al. 2011). The time of occultation predicted using ephemerides was 23:52:44±4 sec. The maximum duration of the occultation was 0.4 sec, provided that the observing site was located at the centre of the occultation track (strip). A drop in the star’s brightness observed during occultation was about 8 m . The occultation event was recorded as a sequence of GIF images with the exposure time of 0.5 sec per frame. The system clock of the computer used for the occultation recording was controlled with a GPS receiver in a fashion similar to that described in the paper by Karbovsky et al. (2017). The data processing yielded an estimate of the occultation duration of 0.46±0.04 sec. The uncertainty of the occultation start time within exposure results in the total estimate of accuracy in timing the maximum phase of occultation 23:52:44.06±0.10 sec. The chord length across the asteroid estimated by timing the occultation is L = 9.2±0.8. This chord length is close to the estimates of the asteroid diameter reported in the paper by Masiero et al. (2011).","astronomy"
"The one of main tasks for solving the as teroid-cometary hazard problem is cataloging all objects that might come extremely close to Earth and pose a poten tial threat of collision. The reliability of their orbits significantly depends on the quality and the statistical treatment of astrometric observations, which are obtained by different observers and different techniques. Statistical analysis of the IAU MPC observational array of the small Solar system bodies and the development of a scheme for assigning weights to individual observation sets are im portant for performing asteroid orbit determination and refinement. Errors in the positions of asteroids associated with errors in the reference catalogs, observation epoch, observed brightness and rate of motion are considered in sufficient detail in investigations of Chesley et al. (2010), Farnocchia (2015), Vereš et al. (2017). Timing and geolo cation uncertainties of the observer are less discussed in the literature. But in the case of observations of NEAs, espe cially at the moments of the close approaches to the Earth, timing errors and errors in the observatory's geolocation can significantly affect the accuracy of the obtained positions. Residual differences (O - C) in the equatorial coordinate system are usually used to search and identify functional errors dependencies. To detect errors caused by timing uncertainties, instead of residual differences (О - С) in equatorial coordinates, it is more convenient to use their along-track and cross-track representation. The cross-track differences are independent of timing errors and indicate only astrometric errors. On the other hand, timing errors are fully contained in the along-track component. Here we present the simulation results of such errors and analysis using an array of observations from three observatories for the period 2017 - 2022. The array con tains more than 18,000 positions of about 900 objects. Most of the objects belong to the group of NEAs, which include PHAs during close approaches to the Earth.","astronomy"

"One of the fundamental questions in astronomy is how planetary systems form and evolve. Measuring the planetary occurrence and architecture as a function of time directly addresses this question. In the fourth paper of the Planets Across Space and Time series, we investigate the occurrence and architecture of Kepler planetary systems as a function of kinematic age by using the LAMOST–Gaia–Kepler sample. To isolate the age effect, other stellar properties (e.g., metallicity) have been controlled. We find the following results. (1) The fraction of stars with Kepler-like planets (F Kep) is about 50% for all stars; no significant trend is found between F Kep and age. (2) The average planet multiplicity ( N ¯ p ) exhibits a decreasing trend (∼2σ significance) with age. It decreases from N ¯ p ∼ 3 for stars younger than 1 Gyr to N ¯ p ∼ 1.8 for stars of about 8 Gyr. (3) The number of planets per star (η = F Kep× N ¯ p ) also shows a decreasing trend (∼2σ–3σ significance). It decreases from η ∼ 1.6–1.7 for young stars to η ∼ 1.0 for old stars. (4) The mutual orbital inclination of the planets (σ i,k ) increases from 1 .° 2 − 0.5 + 1.4 to 3 .° 5 − 2.3 + 8.1 as the stars age from 0.5 to 8 Gyr with a best fit of log σ i , k = 0.2 + 0.4 × log Age 1 Gyr . Interestingly, the solar system also fits such a trend. The fact that F Kep remains relatively constant at approximately ∼ 50% across different ages suggests the robustness of planet formation throughout the history of the Galaxy. The age dependence of N ¯ p and σ i,k demonstrates that the planetary architecture is evolving, and planetary systems generally become dynamically hotter with fewer planets as they age.","astronomy"
"The Gas Pixel Detector is a gas detector, sensitive to the polarization of X-rays, currently flying onboard the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE)—the first observatory dedicated to X-ray polarimetry. It detects X-rays and their polarization by imaging the ionization tracks generated by photoelectrons absorbed in the sensitive volume, and then reconstructing the initial direction of the photoelectrons. The primary ionization charge is multiplied and ultimately collected on a finely pixellated ASIC specifically developed for X-ray polarimetry. The signal of individual pixels is processed independently and gain variations can be substantial, of the order of 20%. Such variations need to be equalized to correctly reconstruct the track shape, and therefore its polarization direction. The method to do such equalization is presented here and is based on the comparison between the mean charge of a pixel with respect to the other pixels for equivalent events. The method is shown to finely equalize the response of the detectors onboard IXPE, allowing a better track reconstruction and energy resolution, and can in principle be applied to any imaging detector based on tracks.","astronomy"
"The current and upcoming large data volume galaxy surveys require the use of machine-learning techniques to maximize their scientific return. This study explores the use of Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) to estimate galaxy parameters with a focus on handling cases of missing data and providing realistic probability distribution functions for the parameters. We train an SOM with a simulated mass-limited lightcone assuming a ugrizY JHK s +IRAC data set, mimicking the Hyper Suprime-Cam Deep joint data set. For parameter estimation, we derive SOM likelihood surfaces considering photometric errors to derive total (statistical and systematic) uncertainties. We explore the effects of missing data, including which bands are particularly critical to the accuracy of the derived parameters. We demonstrate that the parameter recovery is significantly better when the missing bands are “filled in” rather than if they are completely omitted. We propose a practical method for such recovery of missing data.","astronomy"
"BVR c I c light curves of NSVS 5066754 were taken on 2014 May at Dark Sky Observatory in North Carolina. This variable is a solar-type eclipsing binary (T1 ∼ 5750 K) with a period of only 0.3751689(1) days. It appeared to be one of the shortest periods in Shaw’s list of near-contact binaries. The Binary Maker fits and our Wilson–Devinney solutions show that the binary could have both semidetached and marginal contact binary configurations. Five new times of minimum light were calculated, along with two minima determined from archived All Sky Automated Survey observations. From these minima and the discovery epoch, a quadratic ephemeris was determined. Thus, a magnetic braking scenario is possible. Both semidetached and contact models were explored. A marginal contact solution had the best sum of square residuals. It gave a mass ratio of ∼0.5, and a component temperature difference of ∼360 K, albeit somewhat large for a contact binary. Two substantial cool spots were determined in this solution with 37° and 28° radii and t-factors or 0.94 and 0.78 respectively. The fill-out is very shallow, ∼106%. It may have recently achieved contact.","astronomy"
"Owing to technological advances, the number of exoplanets discovered has risen dramatically in the last few years. However, when trying to observe Earth analogs, it is often difficult to test the veracity of detection. We have developed a new approach to the analysis of exoplanetary spectral observations based on temporal multifractality, which identifies timescales that characterize planetary orbital motion around the host star and those that arise from stellar features such as spots. Without fitting stellar models to spectral data, we show how the planetary signal can be robustly detected from noisy data using noise amplitude as a source of information. For observation of transiting planets, combining this method with simple geometry allows us to relate the timescales obtained to primary and secondary eclipse of the exoplanets. Making use of data obtained with ground-based and space-based observations we have tested our approach on HD 189733b. Moreover, we have investigated the use of this technique in measuring planetary orbital motion via Doppler shift detection. Finally, we have analyzed synthetic spectra obtained using the SOAP 2.0 tool, which simulates a stellar spectrum and the influence of the presence of a planet or a spot on that spectrum over one orbital period. We have demonstrated that, so long as the signal-to-noise-ratio ≥ 75, our approach reconstructs the planetary orbital period, as well as the rotation period of a spot on the stellar surface.","astronomy"
"We present the development of a photometrically selected massive galaxy catalog, targeting Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs) and massive blue galaxies at redshifts of . Massive galaxy candidates are selected using infrared/optical color–color cuts, with optical data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and infrared data from “unWISE” forced photometry derived from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). The selection method is based on previously developed techniques to select LRGs with , and is optimized using receiver operating characteristic curves. The catalog contains 16,191,145 objects, selected over the full SDSS DR10 footprint. The redshift distribution of the resulting catalog is estimated using spectroscopic redshifts from the DEEP2 Galaxy Redshift Survey and photometric redshifts from COSMOS. Restframe U − B colors from DEEP2 are used to estimate LRG selection efficiency. Using DEEP2, the resulting catalog has an average redshift of z = 0.65, with a standard deviation of , and an average restframe of , with a standard deviation of . Using COSMOS, the resulting catalog has an average redshift of z = 0.60, with a standard deviation of . We estimate of the catalog to be blue galaxies with .

"Several coronagraph designs have been proposed over the last two decades to directly image exoplanets. Among these designs, vector vortex coronagraphs provide theoretically perfect starlight cancellation along with small inner working angles when deployed on telescopes with unobstructed pupils. However, current and planned space missions and ground-based extremely large telescopes present complex pupil geometries, including large central obscurations caused by secondary mirrors, which prevent vortex coronagraphs from rejecting on-axis sources entirely. Recent solutions combining the vortex phase mask with a ring-apodized pupil have been proposed to circumvent this issue, but provide a limited throughput for vortex charges . We present pupil plane apodizations for charge 2, 4, and 6 vector vortex coronagraphs that compensate for pupil geometries with circularly symmetric central obstructions caused by on-axis secondary mirrors. These apodizations are derived analytically and allow vortex coronagraphs to retain theoretically perfect nulling in the presence of obstructed pupils. For a charge 4 vortex, we design polynomial apodization functions assuming a grayscale apodizing filter that represent a substantial gain in throughput over the ring-apodized vortex coronagraph design, while for a charge 6 vortex, we design polynomial apodized vortex coronagraphs that have total energy throughput for the entire range of central obscuration sizes studied. We propose methods for optimizing apodizations produced with either grayscale apodizing filters or shaped mirrors. We conclude by demonstrating how this design may be combined with apodizations numerically optimized for struts and primary mirror segment gaps to design terrestrial exoplanet imagers for complex pupils.","astronomy"
"We develop a Hamiltonian analytical theory for the rotation of a Poincaré Earth model (rigid mantle and liquid core) at the second order with respect to the lunisolar potential and moving ecliptic term. Since the Andoyer variables considered in the first-order solution present virtual singularities, i.e., vanishing divisors, we introduce a set of nonsingular complex canonical variables. This choice allows for applying the Hori canonical perturbation method in a standard way. We derive analytical expressions for the first- and second-order solutions of the precession and nutation of the angular momentum axis (Poisson terms). Contrary to first-order theories, there is a part of the Poisson terms that does depend on the Earth’s structure. The resulting numerical amplitudes, not incorporated in the International Astronomical Union nutation standard, are not negligible considering current accuracies. They are at the microarcsecond level for a few terms, with a very significant contribution in obliquity of about 40 μas for the nutation argument with period −6798.38 days. The structure-dependent amplitudes present a large amplification with respect to the rigid model due to the fluid core resonance. The features of such resonance, however, are different from those found in first-order solutions. The most prominent is that it does not depend directly on the second-order nutation argument but rather on the combination of first-order arguments generating it. It entails that some first-order approaches, like those based on the transfer function, cannot be applied to obtain the second-order contributions.","astronomy"
"NASA’s Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission is expected to discover hundreds of planets via single transits first identified in their light curves. Determining the orbital period of these single-transit candidates typically requires a significant amount of follow-up work to observe a second transit or measure a radial velocity (RV) orbit. In Yao et al., we developed simulations that demonstrated the ability to use archival photometric data in combination with TESS to “precover” the orbital period for these candidates with a precision of several minutes, assuming circular orbits. In this work, we incorporate updated models for TESS single transits, allowing for eccentric orbits, along with an updated methodology to improve the reliability of the results. Additionally, we explore how RV observations can be used to follow up single-transit events, using strategies distinct from those employed when the orbital period is known. We find that the use of an estimated period based on a circular orbit to schedule reconnaissance RV observations can efficiently distinguish eclipsing binaries from planets. For candidates that pass reconnaissance RV observations, we simulate RV monitoring campaigns that enable one to obtain an approximate orbital solution. We find that this method can regularly determine the orbital periods for planets more massive than 0.5 M J with orbital periods as long as 100 days.","astronomy"
"I assemble 4684 star-forming early-type galaxies (ETGs) and 2011 composite ETGs (located in the composite region on the BPT diagram) from the catalog of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 MPA-JHU emission-line measurements. I compare the properties of both ETG samples and investigate their compositions, stellar masses, specific star formation rates (sSFRs), and excitation mechanisms. Compared with star-forming ETGs, composite ETGs have higher stellar mass and lower sSFR. In the stellar mass and u − r color diagram, more than 60% of star-forming ETGs and composite ETGs are located in the green valley, showing that the two ETG samples may have experienced star formation and that ∼17% of star-forming ETGs lie in the blue cloud, while ∼30% of composite ETGs lie in the red sequence. In the [N II]/Hα versus EWHα (the Hα equivalent width) diagram, all star-forming ETGs and most of the composite ETGs are located in the star-forming galaxy region, and composite ETGs have lower EWHα than their counterparts. We show the relations between 12+log(O/H) and log(N/O) for both ETG samples, and suggest that nitrogen production of some star-forming ETGs can be explained by the evolution scheme of Coziol et al., while the prodution of composite ETGs may be a consequence of the inflowing of metal-poor gas and these more evolved massive galaxies.","astronomy"
"Many exoplanets have orbital characteristics quite different from those seen in our own solar system, including planets locked in orbital resonances and planets on orbits that are elliptical or highly inclined from their host star’s spin axis. It is debated whether the wide variety in system architecture is primarily due to differences in formation conditions (nature) or due to evolution over time (nurture). Identifying trends between planetary and stellar properties, including stellar age, can help distinguish between these competing theories and offer insights as to how planets form and evolve. However, it can be challenging to determine whether observed trends between planetary properties and stellar age are driven by the age of the system—pointing to evolution over time being an important factor—or other parameters to which the age may be related, such as stellar mass or stellar temperature. The situation is complicated further by the possibilities of selection biases, small number statistics, uncertainties in stellar age, and orbital evolution timescales that are typically much shorter than the range of observed ages. Here, we develop a Bayesian statistical framework to assess the robustness of such observed correlations and to determine whether they are indeed due to evolutionary processes, are more likely to reflect different formation scenarios, or are merely coincidental. We apply this framework to reported trends between stellar age and 2:1 orbital resonances, spin–orbit misalignments, and hot Jupiters’ orbital eccentricities. We find strong support for the nurture hypothesis only in the final case.","astronomy"
"Debris disk stars are good targets for high-contrast imaging searches for planetary systems, since debris disks have been shown to have a tentative correlation with giant planets. We selected 20 stars identified as debris disk hosts by the WISE mission, with particularly high levels of warm dust. We observed these with the VLT/SPHERE high-contrast imaging instrument with the goal of finding planets and imaging the disks in scattered light. Our survey reaches a median 5σ sensitivity of 10.4 M J at 25 au and 5.9 M J at 100 au. We identified three new stellar companions (HD 18378B, HD 19257B, and HD 133778B): two are mid-M-type stars and one is a late-K or early-M star. Three additional stars have very widely separated stellar companions (all at &gt;2000 au) identified in the Gaia catalog. The stars hosting the three SPHERE-identified companions are all older (≳700 Myr), with one having recently left the main sequence and one a giant star. We infer that the high volumes of dust observed around these stars has been caused by a recent collision between the planets and planetesimal belts in the system, although for the most evolved star, mass loss could also be responsible for the infrared excess. Future mid-infrared spectroscopy or polarimetric imaging may allow the positions and spatial extent of these dust belts to be constrained, thereby providing evidence as to the true cause of the elevated levels of dust around these old systems. None of the disks in this survey is resolved in scattered light.","astronomy"
"An exotic environment surrounds the young stellar groups associated with the Canis Major (CMa) OB1/R1 region, which probably was formed under feedback from at least three supernova events having occurred a few million years ago. We use astrometric data from the Gaia-DR2 to confirm the membership of the stars in CMa R1, based on proper motion and parallax, which revealed 514 new members and candidates. The mean age of 5 Myr estimated from the color–magnitude diagram characterizes the sources as likely pre-main-sequence candidates. In total, a sample of 694 stars detected with the T80-South telescope was analyzed according to different color–color diagrams, which were compared with theoretical colors from evolutionary models, aiming to reveal the objects that exhibit color excess due to accretion processes. Accretion and magnetic activity were also explored on the basis of empirical flux–flux relation, such as F 660 and F 861 that are related to Hα and Ca ii triplet emission, respectively. A low fraction (∼3 percent) of the sample have Hα excess and other colors expected for stars exhibiting chromospheric activity. The number of Class I and Class II objects, identified by the infrared (Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer) colors, indicates a disk fraction of ∼6 percent, which is lower than that expected for stellar clusters with a similar age. Such a large sample of objects associated with CMa R1 without evidences of circumstellar accretion can be interpreted as a lack of disk-bearing stars, unusual for young star-forming regions. However, this may be explained as the result of supernova events.","astronomy"
"High-contrast instruments are required for direct imaging of faint exoplanets around bright host stars. In high-contrast instruments, a wave front control system is needed to generate a dark hole by suppressing residual stellar speckles. However, the achievable contrast is limited by the phase quantization error (i.e., finite phase resolution) of wave front control devices, such as deformable mirrors or spatial light modulators. In this paper, we propose a halftone method for wave front control to improve the contrast using a wave front control device with quantized phase modulation. In a numerical simulation, the contrast was improved from 1.4 × 10−9 to 3.8 × 10−10 by halftone wave front control. In addition, we performed a laboratory demonstration in which a spatial light modulator was used for wave front control, and the contrast was improved from 2.2 × 10−7 to 6.0 × 10−8 for a phase resolution of 2π/256.","astronomy"
"We analyze the microlensing event OGLE-2011-BLG-0173, which shows a small perturbation at the end of the microlensing event caused by the primary lens. We consider both binary lens and binary source models and explore their degeneracies, some of which have not previously been recognized. There are two families of binary lens solutions, one with a mass ratio q ≈ 4 × 10−4 and a separation s ≈ 4.6, and the other with q ≈ 0.015 and s ≈ 0.22, i.e., both have companions in the planetary regime. We search for solutions by using Bayesian analysis that includes planet frequency as a prior and find that the s ≈ 4.6 family is the preferred one with a planet on an orbit of ∼10 au. The degeneracies arise from a paucity of information on the anomaly, demonstrating that high-cadence observations are essential for characterizing wide-orbit microlensing planets. Hence, we predict that the planned Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope microlensing survey will be less prone to these degeneracies than the ongoing ground-based surveys. We discuss the known low-mass, wide-orbit companions and notice that for the largest projected separations the mass ratios are either high (consistent with brown dwarf companions) or low (consistent with Uranus analogs), but intermediate mass ratios (Jupiter analogs on wide orbits) have not been detected to date, despite the fact that the sensitivity to such planets should be higher than that of Uranus analogs. This is therefore tentative evidence of the existence of a massive ice giant desert at wide separations. On the other hand, given their low intrinsic detection sensitivity, Uranus analogs may be ubiquitous.","astronomy"
"We monitored a 3 deg2 area toward Serpens Main in the Pan-STARRS1 r, i, and z bands from 2016 April to September. Light curves of more than 11,000 stars in each band were obtained, and 143 variables have been identified. Among those, 119 variables are new discoveries, while 24 variables were previously known. We present variability classes and periods of 99 stars. Of these, 81 are located in the upper giant branch, displaying long periods, while the remaining 18 variables are pre-main-sequence objects with short periods. We also identify eight eclipsing binary systems, including the known binary V0623 Ser, and derive their physical parameters. According to a clustering analysis of Gaia DR2 stars in the observed field, there are 10 variable members in Serpens Main, where six members have been classified as young stellar objects in previous studies. Here we provide color–magnitude and color–color diagrams for these variables. The color variability of most variables in the color–magnitude diagrams produces the expected displacements, while the movements of cluster members point in different directions; this behavior may be associated with accretion spots or circumstellar disks.","astronomy"
"We analyze the uncertainty in grain size estimation of pure methane (CH4) and nitrogen saturated with methane (N2:CH4) ices, the most abundant volatile materials on trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) and Kuiper Belt objects (KBOs). We compare the single scattering albedo, which determines the grain size estimation of outer solar system regolith, of these ices using the Mie scattering model and two other Hapke approximations (Hapke 1993) in radiative transfer scattering models (RTMs) at near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths (1–5 μm). The equivalent slab (Hapke slab) approximation model predicts results much closer to Mie scattering over the NIR wavelengths at a wide range of grain sizes. In contrast, even though the internal scattering model predicts an approximate particle diameter close to the Mie model for particles with a 10 μm radii, it exhibits higher discrepancies in the predicted estimation for larger grain sizes (e.g., 100 and 1000 μm radii). Owing to the Rayleigh effect on single-scattering properties, neither Hapke approximate models could predict an accurate grain size estimation for the small particles (radii ≤5 μm). We recommend that future studies should favor the Hapke slab approximation when employing RTMs for estimating grain sizes of the vast number of TNOs and KBOs in the outer solar system.","astronomy"
"The Star Formation Across Cosmic Time (SFACT) survey is a new narrowband survey designed to detect emission-line galaxies (ELGs) and quasi-stellar objects (QSOs) over a wide range of redshifts in discrete redshift windows. The survey utilizes the WIYN 3.5 m telescope and the Hydra multifiber positioner to perform efficient follow-up spectroscopy on galaxies identified in the imaging part of the survey. Because the objects in the SFACT survey are selected by their strong emission lines, it is possible to obtain useful spectra for even the faintest of our sources (r ∼ 25). Here, we present the 453 objects that have spectroscopic data from the three SFACT pilot-study fields, 415 of which are confirmed ELGs. The methodology for processing and measuring these data is outlined in this paper, and example spectra are displayed for each of the three primary emission lines used to detect objects in the survey (Hα, [O III]λ5007, and [O II]λ3727). Spectra of additional QSOs and nonprimary-emission-line detections are also shown as examples. The redshift distribution of the pilot-study sample is examined, and the ELGs are placed in different emission-line diagnostic diagrams in order to distinguish the star-forming galaxies from the active galactic nuclei.","astronomy"
"We present a study of the HD 165054 astrometric calibration field that has been periodically observed with the Gemini Planet Imager (GPI). HD 165054 is a bright star within Baade’s Window, a region of the galactic plane with relatively low extinction from interstellar dust. HD 165054 was selected as a calibrator target due to the high number density of stars within this region (∼3 stars per square arcsecond with H &lt; 22), necessary because of the small field of view of the GPI. Using nine epochs spanning over five years, we have fit a standard five-parameter astrometric model to the astrometry of seven background stars within close proximity to HD 165054 (ρ &lt; 2″). We achieved a proper motion precision of ∼0.3 mas yr−1 and constrained the parallax of each star to be ≲1 mas. Our measured proper motions and parallax limits are consistent with the background stars being a part of the galactic bulge. Using these measurements, we find no evidence of any systematic trend of either the plate scale or the north angle offset of GPI between 2014 and 2019. We compared our model describing the motions of the seven background stars to observations of the same field in 2014 and 2018 obtained with Keck/NIRC2, an instrument with excellent astrometric calibration. We find that the predicted position of the background sources is consistent with that measured by NIRC2, within the uncertainties of the calibration of the two instruments. In the future, we will use this field as a standard astrometric calibrator for the upgrade of GPI and potentially for other high-contrast imagers.","astronomy"
"The occultation of the radio galaxy 0141+268 by the asteroid (372) Palma on 2017 May 15 was observed using six antennas of the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA). The shadow of Palma crossed the VLBA station at Brewster, Washington. Owing to the wavelength used, and the size and the distance of the asteroid, a diffraction pattern in the Fraunhofer regime was observed. The measurement retrieves both the amplitude and the phase of the diffracted electromagnetic wave. This is the first astronomical measurement of the phase shift caused by diffraction. The maximum phase shift is sensitive to the effective diameter of the asteroid. The bright spot at the shadow’s center, the so called Arago–Poisson spot, is clearly detected in the amplitude time-series, and its strength is a good indicator of the closest angular distance between the center of the asteroid and the radio source. A sample of random shapes constructed using a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm suggests that the silhouette of Palma deviates from a perfect circle by 26 ± 13%. The best-fitting random shapes resemble each other, and we suggest their average approximates the shape of the silhouette at the time of the occultation. The effective diameter obtained for Palma, 192.1 ± 4.8 km, is in excellent agreement with recent estimates from thermal modeling of mid-infrared photometry. Finally, our computations show that because of the high positional accuracy, a single radio interferometric occultation measurement can reduce the long-term ephemeris uncertainty by an order of magnitude.","astronomy"
"Symbiotic stars (SySts) are long-period interacting binaries composed of a hot compact star, an evolved giant star, and a tangled network of gas and dust nebulae. They represent unique laboratories for studying a variety of important astrophysical problems, and have also been proposed as possible progenitors of SNIa. Presently, we know of 257 SySts in the Milky Way and 69 in external galaxies. However, these numbers are still in striking contrast with the predicted population of SySts in our Galaxy. Because of other astrophysical sources that mimic SySt colors, no photometric diagnostic tool has so far demonstrated the power to unambiguously identify a SySt, thus making the recourse to costly spectroscopic follow-up still inescapable. In this paper we present the concept, commissioning, and science verification phases, as well as the first scientific results, of RAMSES II—a Gemini Observatory Instrument Upgrade Project that has provided each GMOS instrument at both Gemini telescopes with a set of narrow-band filters centered on the Raman O vi 6830 Å band. Continuum-subtracted images using these new filters clearly revealed known SySts with a range of Raman O vi line strengths, even in crowed fields. RAMSES II observations also produced the first detection of Raman O vi emission from the SySt LMC 1 and confirmed Hen 3-1768 as a new SySt—the first photometric confirmation of a SySt. Via Raman O vi narrow-band imaging, RAMSES II provides the astronomical community with the first purely photometric tool for hunting SySts in the local universe.","astronomy"
"N-body simulations have shown that a bar in a galaxy can be triggered by two processes: (1) by its own instabilities in the disk, or (2) by interactions with other galaxies. Both mechanisms have been widely studied. However, the literature has not shown measurements of the critical limits of the disk stability parameters (DSPs). We show measurements of those parameters through the whole evolution in isolated disk models and find that the initial rotation configuration of those models stays in the stable or unstable regime from the initial to the final evolution. Then we perturbed the isolated models to study the evolution of DSPs under perturbation. We find that the critical limits of DSPs are not much affected in barred models, but when the bar is triggered by a perturbation, the disk falls into the unstable regimen. We show in our models that a bar triggered by a light perturbation grows in two phases: first, the bar appears as a slow rotator, and then it evolves to be a fast rotator; second, when the perturbation is far from the target galaxy, the bar evolves from fast to slow rotator. When the bar is triggered by a heavy perturbation, it appears as a fast rotator and evolves to be a slow rotator, similar to classical bar models.","astronomy"
"Prompted by X-ray detections from multiple surveys, we investigated the A-type star HD 63021 and found that it is a double-lined spectroscopic binary with highly variable emission associated with the primary star. Analysis of our multiepoch spectroscopic observations, the majority of which were carried out on small-aperture telescopes, indicates a very short orbital period of just 2.9 days and a mass ratio M 2/M 1 of 0.23. The A1 V star is a slow rotator, with a rotational speed of ∼34 km s−1. Assuming that its mass is 2.3 M ⊙, the present-day secondary is an evolved star of ∼0.5 M ⊙ that nearly fills its Roche lobe. This secondary star rotates comparatively rapidly at ∼44 km s−1, and we see evidence that it is chromospherically active. Analysis of a photometric light curve from TESS reveals two strong periods, one at the orbital period for the system and another at half the orbital period. These findings suggest that HD 63021 is a close binary system undergoing mass transfer from the secondary star onto the primary star—in all ways like an Algol eclipsing binary system, except without the eclipse. We discuss the system’s mass transfer, which is not steady but seems to run in fits and bursts, and infer the system’s basic physical properties from an orbital parameter study, the Roche lobe geometry, and its extant X-ray emission.","astronomy"
"We present the visual orbit of the double-lined eclipsing binary, HD 185912, from long baseline interferometry with the CHARA Array. We also obtain echelle spectra from the Apache Point observatory to update the spectroscopic orbital solution and analyze new photometry from Burggraaff et al. to model the eclipses. By combining the spectroscopic and visual orbital solutions, we find component masses of M 1 = 1.361 ± 0.004 M ⊙ and M 2 = 1.331 ± 0.004 M ⊙, and a distance of d = 40.75 ± 0.30 pc from orbital parallax. From the light-curve solution, we find component radii of R 1 = 1.348 ± 0.016 R ⊙ and R 2 = 1.322 ± 0.016 R ⊙. By comparing these observed parameters to stellar evolution models, we find that HD 185912 is a young system near the zero age main sequence with an estimated age of 500 Myr.","astronomy"
"We propose a nanosatellite Compton telescope based on a silicon tracker, both as a fast and low-cost mission for astrophysics in the MeV regime and as a pathfinder for future large-scale Compton orbital observatories. In this paper we assess the sensitivity of such an instrument for the observation of gamma-ray bursts.","astronomy"
"We report spectroscopy and photometry of the cataclysmic variable stars ASASSN-14ho and V1062 Cyg. Both are dwarf novae with spectra dominated by their secondary stars, which we classify approximately as K4 and M0.5, respectively. Their orbital periods, determined mostly from the secondary stars’ radial velocities, proved to be nearly identical, respectively 350.14 ± 0.15 and 348.25 ± 0.60 minutes. The Hα emission line in V1062 Cyg displays a relatively sharp emission component that tracks the secondary’s motion, which may arise on the irradiated face of the secondary; this is not often seen and may indicate an unusually strong flux of ionizing radiation. Both systems exhibit double-peaked orbital modulation consistent with ellipsoidal variation from the changing aspect of the secondary. We model these variations to constrain the orbital inclination i, and estimate approximate component masses based on i and the secondary velocity amplitude K 2.","astronomy"
"We report the discovery of two mid-infrared nebulae in the northern hemisphere with the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer and the results of optical spectroscopy of their central stars, BD+60° 2668 (composed of two components, separated from each other by ≈3 arcsec) and ALS 19653, with the Calar Alto 3.5 m telescope and the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT), respectively. We classify the components of BD+60° 2668 as stars of spectral types B0.5 II and B1.5 III. ALS 19653 is indicated in the SIMBAD database as a planetary nebula, while our observations show that it is a massive B0.5 Ib star, possibly in a binary system. Using the stellar atmosphere code fastwind, we derived fundamental parameters of the three stars as well as their surface element abundances, implying that all of them are either on the main sequence or only recently left it. This provides further evidence that massive stars can produce circumstellar nebulae while they are still relatively unevolved. We also report the detection of optical counterparts to the mid-infrared nebulae and a second, more extended optical nebula around ALS 19653, and present the results of SALT spectroscopy of both nebulae associated with this star. The possible origin of the nebulae is discussed.","astronomy"
"Uncovering the occurrence rate of terrestrial planets within the habitable zone (HZ) of their host stars has been a particular focus of exoplanetary science in recent years. The statistics of these occurrence rates have largely been derived from transiting planet discoveries, and have uncovered numerous HZ planets in compact systems around M-dwarf host stars. Here we explore the width of the HZ as a function of spectral type, and the dynamical constraints on the number of stable orbits within the HZ for a given star. We show that, although the Hill radius for a given planetary mass increases with larger semimajor axis, the width of the HZ for earlier-type stars allows for more terrestrial planets in the HZ than late-type stars. In general, dynamical constraints allow ∼6 HZ Earth-mass planets for stellar masses ≳0.7M ⊙, depending on the presence of farther out giant planets. As an example, we consider the case of Beta CVn, a nearby bright solar-type star. We present 20 yr of radial velocities (RV) from the Keck/High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer (HIRES) and Automated Planet Finder (APF) instruments and conduct an injection-recovery analysis of planetary signatures in the data. Our analysis of these RV data rule out planets more massive than Saturn within 10 au of the star. These system properties are used to calculate the potential dynamical packing of terrestrial planets in the HZ and show that such nearby stellar targets could be particularly lucrative for HZ planet detection by direct imaging exoplanet missions.","astronomy"
"As part of our multi-observatory, multifilter campaign, we present r–i color observations of 82 near-Earth objects (NEOs) obtained with the reionization and transients infrared camera (RATIR) instrument on the 1.5 m robotic telescope at the San Pedro Martir’s National Observatory in Mexico. Our project is particularly focused on rapid-response observations of small (≲850 m) NEOs. The rapid response and the use of spectrophotometry allows us to constrain the taxonomic classification of NEOs with high efficiency. Here we present the methodology of our observations and our result, suggesting that the ratio of C-type to S-type asteroids in a size range of ∼30–850 m is 1.1, which is in accordance with our previous results. We also find that 10% of all NEOs in our sample are neither C- nor S-type asteroids","astronomy"
"Hot Neptunes are extrasolar planets that are similar in size to Neptune in our solar system but are much closer to their host stars, completing an orbit in 10 days or less. The origin of hot Neptunes is not fully understood. A potential large third body at a distance can lead to the migration of long-period planets to become much closer to the host star, and such a dynamical process helps explain the origin of hot Jupiters. We investigate whether hot Neptunes could share a similar origin by analyzing radial velocity data from multiple sources for a sample of 34 hot Neptune systems. Hot Neptune systems appear to have similar values of linear trend to hot Jupiter systems. We perform a maximum likelihood analysis to constrain the mass and distance distribution of the putative third body. The overall fraction of hot Neptune systems with third bodies is consistent with unity, higher than 71% at the 2σ level. On average, the mass and distance distribution of the third bodies for hot Neptune systems is consistent with that for hot Jupiter systems. Our results suggest that hot-Neptune systems share the same origin mechanism as hot Jupiters, e.g., through the gravitational effect of third bodies.","astronomy"
"Recently, it has been shown that rocky planets orbiting neutron stars can be habitable under plausible circumstances. If a distant, point-like source of visible light, such as a Sun-like main-sequence star or the gravitationally-lensed accretion disk of a supermassive black hole is present, possible temporal variations Δ ε p t of the planet’s axial tilt ε p to the ecliptic plane should be included in the overall habitability budget since the obliquity determines the insolation at a given latitude on a body’ s surface. I point out that, for rather generic initial spin–orbit initial configurations, general relativistic and classical spin variations induced by the post-Newtonian de Sitter and Lense–Thirring components of the field of the host neutron star and by its pull to the planetary oblateness J 2 p may induce huge and very fast variations of ε p that would likely have an impact on the habitability of such worlds. In particular, for a planet’s distance of, say, 0.005 au from a 1.4 M ⊙ neutron star corresponding to an orbital period P b = 0.109 day, obliquity shifts Δε p as large as ε p max − ε p min ≃ 50 ° – 100 ° over characteristic timescales as short as 10 days ( J 2 p ) to 3 Myr (Lense–Thirring) may occur for arbitrary orientations of the orbital and spin angular momenta L , S ns, S p of the planet-neutron star system. In view of this feature of their spins, I dub such hypothetical planets as “nethotrons.”","astronomy"
"We present new spatially resolved astrometry and photometry of the CD –27°11535 system, a member of the β Pictoris moving group consisting of two resolved K-type stars on a ∼20 yr orbit. We fit an orbit to relative astrometry measured from NIRC2, GPI, and archival NaCo images, in addition to literature measurements. However, the total mass inferred from this orbit is significantly discrepant from that inferred from stellar evolutionary models using the luminosity of the two stars. We explore two hypotheses that could explain this discrepant mass sum: a discrepant parallax measurement from Gaia due to variability, and the presence of an additional unresolved companion to one of the two components. We find that the ∼20 yr orbit could not bias the parallax measurement, but that variability of the components could produce a large-amplitude astrometric motion, an effect that cannot be quantified exactly without the individual Gaia measurements. The discrepancy could also be explained by an additional star in the system. We jointly fit the astrometric and photometric measurements of the system to test different binary and triple architectures for the system. Depending on the set of evolutionary models used, we find an improved goodness of fit for a triple system architecture that includes a low-mass (M = 0.177 ± 0.055 M ⊙) companion to the primary star. Further studies of this system will be required in order to resolve this discrepancy, either by refining the parallax measurement with a more complex treatment of variability-induced astrometric motion or by detecting a third companion.","astronomy"
"Considering subglacial liquid water, a significant extension of the classical Habitable Zone is obtained. Elaborating on the model of Wandel it is shown how an atmosphere and liquid water could survive on tidally locked planets closely orbiting an M-dwarf host, extending the Habitable Zone boundary inwards. In addition, subglacial liquid water could extend the Habitable Zone beyond the outer boundary of the conservative Habitable Zone as well. These two results enhance the circumstellar region with a potential for liquid water well beyond the conservative boundaries of the classical Habitable Zone. It is argued that the probable recent JWST detection of atmospheric water vapor on the rocky Earth-sized exoplanet GJ 486 b, along with earlier detections of water on other planets orbiting M-dwarf stars, gives an empirical answer to the much-argued question of whether such planets can support liquid water, organic chemistry, and eventually life. It is shown how water on terrestrial planets closely orbiting M-dwarf stars may sustain in a subglacial melting layer. Finally, the model is applied to a few exoplanets demonstrating how water detection may constrain their atmospheric properties.","astronomy"
"Narrowband radio search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) in the 21st century suffers severely from radio frequency interference (RFI), resulting in a high number of false positives, and it could be the major reason why we have not yet received any messages from space. We thereby propose a novel observation strategy, called MultiBeam Point-source Scanning (MBPS), to revolutionize the way RFI is identified in narrowband radio SETI and provide a prominent solution to the current situation. The MBPS strategy is a simple yet powerful method that sequentially scans over the target star with different beams of a telescope, creating real-time references in the time domain for cross-verification and thus potentially identifying all continuous RFI with a level of certainty never achieved in any previous attempts. By applying the MBPS strategy during the observation of TRAPPIST-1 with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope, we successfully identified all 6972 received signals as RFI using the solid criteria introduced by the MBPS strategy. Therefore, we present the MBPS strategy as a promising tool that should bring us much closer to the first discovery of a genuine galactic greeting.","astronomy"
"The present paper is devoted to the investigation how the disk structure is depending from the one-point wind one in microquasar CYG X-1. The results show that when the region in which the wind is absent in the vicinity of one-point has the size less or equal to 0.07 the disk radius is very small, order of 0.08 in units of orbital separation. When this size is increased to 0.115 the disk radius becomes to be of standard size to be equal to 0.22 in units of orbital separation. By the other words these results show that the disk structure is strong depending from many factors including and the donor’s wind configuration in the vicinity of one-point. This configuration is inherent to microquasars only. Indeed, since microqausars are the massive close binary systems; the donor in these systems is massive star from which the strong radiation- driving wind is blowing. On the other hand, in microquasars accretion disks are present and it means that one-point stream is also present in microqausars. It in turn means that the matter configuration in the vicinity of one-point is very complicated since the high mass loss rate donor’s wind and one-point stream must be existing in the vicinity of one-point simultaneously. This situation maybe resolved when we suppose that the central source in an accretion disk will influence on the donor’s atmosphere structure in the vicinity of one-point and in turn will be result in the break of wind in the vicinity of one-point. This finally will be means that one-point stream will be existing in one-point without a wind and it, flowing in the accretor’s Roche lobe, will be result in an accretion disk forma- tion. Here one problem is arising: what is the configuration of wind in the extended vicinity of one-point and from what the parameters this configuration is depending and haw this configuration will be results to the disk structure change. We good understand that this situation is arising in the case of microquasars only and we try to resolve this problem in the present paper.","astronomy"
"We present photometric observations in Sloan filters g?, i? of the short-period eclipsing stars KR Lyn, CSS J110212+244412, NSVS 4917488 and NSVS 7336024. The light curve solutions revealed that all targets are overcontact binaries whose components are G and K stars. Their temperature differences do not exceed 300 K but they differ considerably in size and mass. NSVS 4917488 and NSVS 7336024 reveal total eclipses and their parameters can be considered as well-determined.

"The Magellanic Stream (MS) is the nearest example of a gaseous trail formed by interacting galaxies. While the substantial gas masses in these kinds of circumgalactic structures are postulated to represent important sources of fuel for future star formation, the mechanisms whereby this material might be accreted back into galaxies remain unclear. Recent neutral hydrogen (HI) observations have demonstrated that the northern portion of the MS, which probably has been interacting with the Milky Way's hot gaseous halo for close to 1000 Myr, has a larger spatial extent than previously recognized, while also containing significant amounts of small-scale structure. After a brief consideration of the large-scale kinematics of the MS as traced by the recently-discovered extension of the MS, we explore the aging process of the MS gas through the operation of various hydrodynamic instabilities and interstellar turbulence. This in turn leads to consideration of processes whereby MS material survives as cool gas, and yet also evidently fails to form stars. Parallels between the MS and extragalactic tidal features are brie'y discussed with an emphasis on steps toward establishing what the MS reveals about the critical role of local processes in determining the evolution of these kinds of systems.","astronomy"
"The Voyager 1 (V1) and Voyager 2 (V2) spacecraft were launched in 1977 on a mission to explore the outer planets and reach the heliopause, the boundary between the hot solar plasma and the relatively cool interstellar plasma. V1 reached the heliopause on 2012 August 25, at 121.6 au, and V2 reached the heliopause on 2018 November 5, at 119.0 au. One of their remarkable discoveries was the detection of shocks propagating into the interstellar plasma from energetic solar events. These shocks are typically preceded by electron plasma oscillations excited by electron beams streaming along interstellar magnetic field lines ahead of the shocks. The frequencies of the plasma oscillations have now provided radial electron density profiles in the outer heliosphere and in the interstellar medium to radial distances of more than 145 au. The oscillations are typically preceded by bursts of high-energy ∼5–100 MeV electrons. These electron bursts are interpreted as being due to the reflection (and acceleration) of cosmic-ray electrons by the shock at the time the shock first contacts the magnetic field line that passes through the spacecraft. Relative timing between the cosmic rays reflected by the shock and the onset of the plasma oscillations allow us, for the first time, to estimate the energy, ∼20–100 eV, of the electron beams responsible for the plasma oscillations. These observations are combined into a self-consistent model called the foreshock model that describes the interaction of shocks of solar origin with the interstellar plasma.","astronomy"
"The purpose of this work is to describe the assumptions built into the X-ray spectrum fitting software XSPEC for the calculation of element abundances and emission measure of a plasma and to describe the effects when those assumptions are not accurate. The ratio of electron density to hydrogen density in XSPEC is fixed at a constant. The correct ratio can be calculated from the ionization states of the elements. We show the constant value used in XSPEC is valid to within ≃3.5% for a solar-abundance plasma. For a plasma that deviates from solar abundance, e.g., hydrogen-poor or heavy-element-rich plasmas such as those found in the ejecta of supernova remnants, this ratio can be smaller by factors of 0.1–0.001. The hydrogen emission measure, defined by integral of electron density times hydrogen density over plasma volume, is derived from the norm in XSPEC, but one needs to include the hydrogen abundance factor. For other elements, the emission measures are the XSPEC values multiplied by the element abundance factors. Using the correct electron-to-hydrogen ratio and emission measures, we show the correct electron density is smaller by the square root of the correct electron density ratio divided by the XSPEC value. Element densities and total masses (for given distance and volume) are larger by the abundance factors divided by the above square root. Because hydrogen-poor plasmas occur in the ejecta of Type Ia supernova remnants, previously estimated element masses from X-ray spectra are likely to be significantly underestimated.","astronomy"
"The icy materials present in comets provide clues to the origin and evolution of our solar system and planetary systems. High-resolution optical spectroscopic observations of comet C/2014 Q2 (Lovejoy) were performed on 2015 January 11 (at 1.321 au pre-perihelion) with the High Dispersion Spectrograph mounted on the Subaru Telescope on Maunakea, Hawaii. We derive the 14N/15N ratio of NH2 (126 ± 25), as well as the ortho-to-para abundance ratios (OPRs) of the H2O+ ion (2.77 ± 0.24) and NH2 (3.38 ± 0.07), which correspond to nuclear spin temperatures of &gt;24 K (3σ lower limit) and 27 ± 2 K, respectively. We also derive the intensity ratio of the green-to-red doublet of forbidden oxygen lines (0.107 ± 0.007). The ammonia in the comet must have formed under low-temperature conditions at ∼10 K or less to reproduce the observed 14N/15N ratio in this molecule if it is assumed that the 15N-fractionation of ammonia occurred via ion–molecule chemical reactions. However, this temperature is inconsistent with the nuclear spin temperatures of water and ammonia estimated from the OPRs. The interpretation of the nuclear spin temperature as the temperature at molecular formation may therefore be incorrect. An isotope-selective photodissociation of molecular nitrogen by protosolar ultraviolet radiation might play an important role in the 15N-fractionation observed in cometary volatiles.","astronomy"
"We propose a new method of constraining the redshifts of individual extragalactic sources based on celestial coordinates and their ensemble statistics. Techniques from integer linear programming (ILP) are utilized to optimize simultaneously for the angular two-point cross- and autocorrelation functions. Our novel formalism introduced here not only transforms the otherwise hopelessly expensive, brute-force combinatorial search into a linear system with integer constraints but also is readily implementable in off-the-shelf solvers. We adopt Gurobi, a commercial optimization solver, and use Python to build the cost function dynamically. The preliminary results on simulated data show potential for future applications to sky surveys by complementing and enhancing photometric redshift estimators. Our approach is the first application of ILP to astronomical analysis.","astronomy"
"We present the serendipitous discovery of a projected pair of quasi-stellar objects (QSOs) with an angular separation of Δθ = 4.50 arcsec. The redshifts of the two QSOs are widely different: one, our program target, is a QSO with a spectrum consistent with being a narrow line Seyfert 1 active galactic nucleus at z = 2.05. For this target we detect Lyα, C iv, and C iii]. The other QSO, which by chance was included on the spectroscopic slit, is a Type 1 QSO at a redshift of z = 1.68, for which we detect C iv, C iii], and Mg ii. We compare this system to previously detected projected QSO pairs and find that only about a dozen previously known pairs have smaller angular separation.","astronomy"

"It is beneficial to calibrate the period–Wesenheit–metallicity relation (PWZR) of Delta Cephei stars (DCEPs), i.e., classical Cepheids, using accurate parallaxes of associated open clusters (OCs) from Gaia data release 3 (DR3). To this aim, we obtain a total of 43 OC–DCEPs (including 33 fundamental mode, 9 first overtone mode, and 1 multimode DCEPs) and calibrate the PWZR as W G = ( − 3.356 ± 0.033 ) ( log P − 1 ) + ( − 5.947 ± 0.025 ) + (−0.285 ± 0.064)[Fe/H]. The concurrently obtained residual parallax offset in OCs, zp = −4 ± 5 μas, demonstrates the adequacy of the parallax corrections within the magnitude range of OC member stars. By comparing the field DCEPs’ DR3 parallaxes with their photometric parallaxes derived by our PWZR, we estimated the residual parallax offset in field DCEPs as zp = −15 ± 3 μas. Using our PWZR, we estimate the distance modulus of the Large Magellanic Cloud to be 18.482 ± 0.040 mag, which aligns well with the most accurate published value obtained through geometric methods.","astronomy"

"RR Lyrae stars may be the best practical tracers of Galactic halo (sub-)structure and kinematics. The PanSTARRS1 (PS1) 3 π survey offers multi-band, multi-epoch, precise photometry across much of the sky, but a robust identification of RR Lyrae stars in this data set poses a challenge, given PS1's sparse, asynchronous multi-band light curves ( ≲ 12 epochs in each of five bands, taken over a 4.5 year period). We present a novel template fitting technique that uses well-defined and physically motivated multi-band light curves of RR Lyrae stars, and demonstrate that we get accurate period estimates, precise to 2 s in &gt; 80 % of cases. We augment these light-curve fits with other features from photometric time-series and provide them to progressively more detailed machine-learned classification models. From these models, we are able to select the widest (three-fourths of the sky) and deepest (reaching 120 kpc) sample of RR Lyrae stars to date. The PS1 sample of ∼45,000 RRab stars is pure (90%) and complete (80% at 80 kpc) at high galactic latitudes. It also provides distances that are precise to 3%, measured with newly derived period–luminosity relations for optical/near-infrared PS1 bands. With the addition of proper motions from Gaia and radial velocity measurements from multi-object spectroscopic surveys, we expect the PS1 sample of RR Lyrae stars to become the premier source for studying the structure, kinematics, and the gravitational potential of the Galactic halo. The techniques presented in this study should translate well to other sparse, multi-band data sets, such as those produced by the Dark Energy Survey and the upcoming Large Synoptic Survey Telescope Galactic plane sub-survey.","astronomy"
"We present a catalog of Galactic star clusters, associations and candidates with 10978 entries. This multi-band catalog was constructed over 20 years, starting with visual inspections on the Digital Sky Survey and incremented with the 2MASS, WISE, VVV, Spitzer, and Herschel surveys. Large and small catalogs, as well as papers on individual objects have been systematically cross-identified. The catalog provides Galactic and equatorial coordinates, angular diameters, and chronologically ordered designations, making it simple to assign discoveries and verify how often the objects were cataloged by different authors, search methods, and/or surveys. Detection in a single band is the minimum constraint to validate an entry. About 3200 objects have measured parameters in the literature. A fundamental contribution of the present study is to present an additional ≈7700 objects for the first analyses of nature, photometry, spectroscopy and structure. The present focus is not to compile or determine fundamental parameters, but to provide a catalog uniformly characterizing the entries. A major result is that now 4234 embedded clusters are cataloged, a factor of ≈1.5 larger than open clusters. In addition to cross-identifications in different references and wavelength domains, we also communicate the discovery of 638 star clusters and similar objects. The present general catalog provides previously studied objects and thousands of additional entries in a homogeneous way, a timely contribution to Gaia-related works.","astronomy"
"Gaia Early Data Release 3 (EDR3) provides trigonometric parallaxes for 1.5 billion stars, with reduced systematics compared to Gaia Data Release 2 and reported precisions better by up to a factor of 2. New to EDR3 is a tentative model for correcting the parallaxes of magnitude-, position-, and color-dependent systematics for five- and six-parameter astrometric solutions, Z 5 and Z 6. Using a sample of over 2000 first-ascent red giant branch stars with asteroseismic parallaxes, I perform an independent check of the Z 5 model in a Gaia magnitude range of 9 ≲ G ≲ 13 and color range of 1.4 μm−1 ≲ ν eff ≲ 1.5 μm−1. This analysis therefore bridges the Gaia team’s consistency check of Z 5 for G &gt; 13 and indications from independent analysis using Cepheids of a ≈15 μas overcorrection for G &lt; 11. I find overcorrection sets in at G ≲ 10.8, such that Z 5-corrected EDR3 parallaxes are larger than asteroseismic parallaxes by 15 ± 3 μas. For G ≳ 10.8, EDR3 and asteroseismic parallaxes in the Kepler field agree up to a constant consistent with expected spatial variations in EDR3 parallaxes after a linear, color-dependent adjustment. I also infer an average underestimation of EDR3 parallax uncertainties in the sample of 22% ± 6%, consistent with the Gaia team’s estimates at similar magnitudes and independent analysis using wide binaries. Finally, I extend the Gaia team’s parallax spatial covariance model to brighter magnitudes (G &lt; 13) and smaller scales (down to ≈0.°1), where systematic EDR3 parallax uncertainties are at least ≈3–4 μas.","astronomy"
"3C 66A is one of the most interesting blazars and one of our monitoring objects carried out with the 1.56 m telescope at Sheshan station, Shanghai Astronomical Observatory (ShAO). It has been monitored since 1996 December 11. In the present work, we show its optical light curves during the period of 1996 December 11–2009 December 28. From our observations, we found that the largest variations in the V, R, and I bands are , mag, and ΔI = 1.659 ± 0.047 mag, respectively. Intra-day variabilities are found in the three bands: in the V band, an A = 17.7% brightness increase over minutes on JD 2455119, and an brightness increase over minutes on JD 2454816; in the R band, an brightness increase over minutes on JD 2454004, and an brightness increase over minutes on JD 2453995; and in the I band, an brightness decrease over ΔT = 38.44 minutes on JD 2453995, and an brightness decrease over ΔT = 344.02 minutes on JD 2454818. For micro-variability, we found that R variability leads I variability by 25.92 ± 1.09 minutes. When the periodicity analysis methods, with the red noise being considered, are adopted to the V, R, and I observations, we can find that the periodogram to the V data is consistent with red noise, except for 1 CLEANest peak corresponding to the timescale of 696.0 ± 182.0 days, those to the R data are 653.0 ± 171.0 and 156.0 ± 17.0 days; and those to the I data are 801.0 ± 207.0 and 156.0 ± 15.0 days, respectively.","astronomy"
"Measuring the frequency of binary stars in dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) requires data taken over long time intervals. We combine radial velocity measurements from five literature sources taken over the course of ∼30 years to yield the largest multi-epoch kinematic sample for stars in the dSphs Draco and Ursa Minor. With this data set, we are able to implement an improved version of the Bayesian technique described in Spencer et al. to evaluate the binary fraction of red giant stars in these dwarf galaxies. Assuming Duquennoy &amp; Mayor period and mass ratio distributions, the binary fractions in Draco and Ursa Minor are and , respectively. We find that a normal mass ratio distribution is preferred over a flat distribution, and that log-normal period distributions centered on long periods ( ) are preferred over distributions centered on short ones. We reanalyzed the binary fractions in Leo II, Carina, Fornax, Sculptor, and Sextans, and find that there is &lt;1% chance that binary fraction is a constant quantity across all seven dwarfs, unless the period distribution varies greatly. This indicates that the binary populations in Milky Way dSphs are not identical in regard to their binary fractions, period distributions, or both. We consider many different properties of the dwarfs (e.g., mass, radius, luminosity, etc.) and find that binary fraction might be larger in dwarfs that formed their stars quickly and/or have high velocity dispersions.","astronomy"
"We report a new free-floating planet (FFP) candidate, KMT-2017-BLG-2820, with Einstein radius θ E ≃ 6 μas, lens-source relative proper motion μ rel ≃ 8 mas yr−1, and Einstein timescale t E = 6.5 hr. It is the third FFP candidate found in an ongoing study of giant-source finite-source point-lens (FSPL) events in the KMTNet database and the sixth FSPL FFP candidate overall. We find no significant evidence for a host. Based on their timescale distributions and detection rates, we argue that five of these six FSPL FFP candidates are drawn from the same population as the six point-source point-lens (PSPL) FFP candidates found by Mróz et al. in the OGLE-IV database. The θ E distribution of the FSPL FFPs implies that they are either sub-Jovian planets in the bulge or super-Earths in the disk. However, the apparent “Einstein desert” (10 ≲ θ E/μas ≲ 30) would argue for the latter. Whether each of the 12 (six FSPL and six PSPL) FFP candidates is truly an FFP or simply a very wide-separation planet can be determined at first adaptive optics (AO) light on 30 m telescopes, and earlier for some. If the latter, a second epoch of AO observations could measure the projected planet–host separation with a precision of . At the present time, the balance of evidence favors the unbound-planet hypothesis.","astronomy"
"We report new results for the gravitational microlensing target OGLE-2011-BLG-0950 from adaptive optics images using the Keck Observatory. The original analysis by Choi et al. and reanalysis by Suzuki et al. report degenerate solutions between planetary and stellar binary lens systems. This particular case is the most important type of degeneracy for exoplanet demographics because the distinction between a planetary mass or stellar binary companion has direct consequences for microlensing exoplanet statistics. The 8 and 10 yr baselines allow us to directly measure a relative proper motion of 4.20 ± 0.21 mas yr−1, confirming the detection of the lens star system and ruling out the planetary companion models that predict a ∼4× smaller relative proper motion. The Keck data also rule out the wide stellar binary solution unless one of the components is a stellar remnant. The combination of the lens brightness and close stellar binary light-curve parameters yields primary and secondary star masses of M A = 1.12 − 0.09 + 0.11 and M B = 0.47 − 0.10 + 0.13 M ☉ at a distance of D L = 6.70 − 0.30 + 0.55 kpc and a projected separation of 0.39 − 0.04 + 0.05 au. Assuming that the predicted proper motions are measurably different, the high-resolution imaging method described here can be used to disentangle this degeneracy for events observed by the Roman exoplanet microlensing survey using Roman images taken near the beginning or end of the survey.","astronomy"
"We revisit the planetary microlensing event OGLE-2013-BLG-0132/MOA-2013-BLG-148 using Keck adaptive optics imaging in 2013 with NIRC2 and in 2020, 7.4 yr after the event, with OSIRIS. The 2020 observations yield a source and lens separation of 56.91 ± 0.29 mas, which provides us with a precise measurement of the heliocentric proper motion of the event μ rel,hel = 7.695 ± 0.039 mas yr−1. We measured the magnitude of the lens in the K band as K lens = 18.69 ± 0.04. Using these constraints, we refit the microlensing light curve and undertake a full reanalysis of the event parameters including the microlensing parallax π E and the distance to the source D S . We confirm the results obtained in the initial study by Mróz et al. and improve significantly upon the accuracy of the physical parameters. The system is an M dwarf of 0.495 ± 0.054 M ⊙ orbited by a cold, Saturn-mass planet of 0.26 ± 0.028 M Jup at projected separation r ⊥ = 3.14 ± 0.28 au. This work confirms that the planetary system is at a distance of 3.48 ± 0.36 kpc, which places it in the Galactic disk and not the Galactic bulge.","astronomy"
"We present high angular resolution imaging that detects the MOA-2008-BLG-379L exoplanet host star using Keck adaptive optics and the Hubble Space Telescope. These observations reveal host star and planet masses of M host = 0.434 ± 0.065 M ⊙ and m p = 2.44 ± 0.49 M Jupiter. They are located at a distance of D L = 3.44 ± 0.53 kpc, with a projected separation of 2.70 ± 0.42 au. These results contribute to our determination of exoplanet host star masses for the Suzuki et al. statistical sample, which will determine the dependence of the planet occurrence rate on the mass and distance of the host stars. We also present a detailed discussion of the image-constrained modeling version of the eesunhong light-curve modeling code that applies high angular resolution image constraints to the light-curve modeling process. This code increases modeling efficiency by a large factor by excluding models that are inconsistent with the high angular resolution images. The analysis of this and other events from the Suzuki et al. statistical sample reveals the importance of including higher-order effects, such as microlensing parallax and planetary orbital motion, even when these features are not required to fit the light-curve data. The inclusion of these effects may be needed to obtain accurate estimates of the uncertainty of other microlensing parameters that affect the inferred properties of exoplanet microlens systems. This will be important for the exoplanet microlensing survey of the Roman Space Telescope, which will use both light-curve photometry and high angular resolution imaging to characterize planetary microlens systems.","astronomy"
"The Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopy Telescope (LAMOST) is one of the most effective multiobject spectroscopic instruments. Its survey efficiency is guaranteed by simultaneously positioning multiple fibers via 4000 robotic fiber positioners (RFPs). With the further updates to LAMOST, the new-generation RFPs will be smaller, and the number of RFPs will increase to 5000. The RFPs are densely packed with shared working space. Thus, they may collide with each other, leading to them damaged and reducing the survey speed. In this study, we propose a new motion planning algorithm that prevents the collision of RFPs. To simplify the collision avoidance problem, we transform the motion planning process from a dynamic one into a static one by selecting one of the RFPs in each collision pair as the waiting robot. Accordingly, we design a method for choosing the waiting robot, and use a rapidly exploring random tree to plan a collision-free path for the waiting robot. However, there may be blocks between the waiting robots and their neighbors. Therefore, we also design methods to resolve these blocks. Simulations suggest that the proposed algorithm can prevent 98.4% of the collisions. About 99.9% of the positioners can reach their targets without collisions. Although developed for LAMOST, we believe that our algorithm can also be used for other instruments with equal-arm theta-phi positioners, such as the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument.","astronomy"
"In the Sixth Catalog of Orbits of Visual Binary Stars we found those belonging to the Main Sequence to form a sample containing 432 visual binaries. Their total masses were obtained dynamically, i.e. they were calculated using the orbital elements and the new Hipparcos parallaxes. For the same pairs the total mass was also found astrophysically - by applying the mass-luminosity relation. The apparent magnitudes of the components were found in two different ways: by deriving them from total magnitudes and magnitude differences, and by taking their values directly from a catalogue. The results for these two approaches show no essential discrepancy. The values of total masses obtained dynamically have a large dispersion involving even completely unrealistic values. This is a clear indication that the input data are not sufficiently reliable. Nevertheless, in a large number of cases the agreement between total masses obtained by us in two different ways is quite satisfactory indicating that i) for many visual binaries, as a rule not too distant and with high-quality orbital elements, the dynamical total masses can be reliable; ii) the mass-luminosity relation yields quite satisfactory estimates for the component masses when they belong to the Main Sequence and iii) a correlation between the relative parallax error and orbit grade exists.","astronomy"
"Only a handful of late T brown dwarfs have been monitored for spectrophotometric variability, leaving incomplete the study of the atmospheric cloud structures of the coldest brown dwarfs, which share temperatures with some cold, directly imaged exoplanets. 2MASS J00501994–332240 is a T7.0 rapidly rotating, field brown dwarf that showed low-level photometric variability in data obtained with the Spitzer Space Telescope. We monitored 2MASS J00501994–332240 during ∼2.6 hr with MOSFIRE, installed at the Keck I telescope, with the aim of constraining its near-infrared spectrophotometric variability. We measured fluctuations with a peak-to-peak amplitude of 1.48% ± 0.75% in the J-band photometric light curve, an amplitude of 0.62% ± 0.18% in the J-band spectrophotometric light curve, an amplitude of 1.26% ± 0.93% in the H-band light curve, and an amplitude of 5.33% ± 2.02% in the CH4 − H2O band light curve. Nevertheless, the Bayesian information criterion does not detect significant variability in any of the light curves. Thus, given the detection limitations due to the MOSFIRE sensitivity, we can only claim tentative low-level variability for 2M0050–3322 in the best-case scenario. The amplitudes of the peak-to-peak fluctuations measured for 2MASS J00501994–332240 agree with the variability amplitude predictions of general circulation models for a T7.0 brown dwarf for an edge-on object. Radiative transfer models predict that the Na2S and KCl clouds condense at pressures lower than that traced by the CH4–H2O band, which might explain the higher peak-to-peak fluctuations measured for this light curve. Finally, we provide a visual recreation of the map provided by general circulation models and the vertical structure of 2MASS J00501994–332240 provided by radiative transfer models.","astronomy"
"We present new near-infrared Gemini Planet Imager (GPI) spectroscopy of HD 206893 B, a substellar companion orbiting within the debris disk of its F5V star. The J, H, K1, and K2 spectra from GPI demonstrate the extraordinarily red colors of the object, confirming it as the reddest substellar object observed to date. The significant flux increase throughout the infrared presents a challenging atmosphere to model with existing grids. Best-fit values vary from 1200 to 1800 K for effective temperature and from 3.0 to 5.0 for log(g), depending on which individual wavelength band is fit and which model suite is applied. The extreme redness of the companion can be partially reconciled by invoking a high-altitude layer of submicron dust particles, similar to dereddening approaches applied to the peculiar red field L dwarf population. However, reconciling the HD 206893 B spectra with even those of the reddest low-gravity L dwarf spectra still requires the contribution of additional atmospheric dust, potentially due to the debris disk environment in which the companion resides. Orbit fitting from 4 yr of astrometric monitoring is consistent with a ∼30 yr period, an orbital inclination of 147°, and a semimajor axis of 10 au, well within the estimated disk inner radius of ∼50 au. As one of a very few substellar companions imaged interior to a circumstellar disk, the properties of this system offer important dynamical constraints on companion–disk interaction and provide a benchmark for substellar and planetary atmospheric study.","astronomy"
"We present detailed analyses of eight triple stellar systems (lying between 20 and 155 pc) and nine quadruple stellar systems (lying between 20 and 250 pc) with different configurations. Most of these systems are hierarchical. The systems are HIP 4239, HIP 5588, HIP 11072, HIP 12548, HIP 13498, HIP 17895, HIP 19915, HIP 22607, HIP 25240, HIP 28614, HIP 41171, HIP 51255, HIP 51966, HIP 54611, HIP 78977, HIP 89234, and HIP 111805. We followed a method that can be applied to all multiple stellar systems, including the main sequence and subgiant evolutionary stages, to obtain their masses, ages, and atmospheric and fundamental parameters. These parameters were assured by the combined analysis of the astrometric measurements, photometric measurements, dynamical analysis, synthetic photometry, metallicity, and positions of the components on the H-R diagram. The estimated individual masses are of higher accuracy than those given by the dynamical solutions and listed in the MSC. The results show that all components of each of these systems have precisely the same age and metallicity. This ensures that fragmentation is the most probable theory for the formation of these multiple stellar systems. A quadratic fit was calculated for the mass–luminosity relation of the main-sequence subset components. We found that the primary component in all of these systems has evolved off the main-sequence stage, and some of these stars have already entered the subgiant stage.","astronomy"
"We present a method to identify likely visual binaries in Gaia eDR3 that does not rely on parallax or proper motion. This method utilizes the various point-spread function sizes of Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS)/Gaia, where at &lt;2.″5 two stars may be unresolved in 2MASS but resolved by Gaia. Due to this, if close neighbors listed in Gaia are a resolved pair, the associated 2MASS source will have a predictable excess in the J band that depends on the ΔG of the pair. We demonstrate that the expected relationship between 2MASS excess and ΔG differs for chance alignments, as compared to true binary systems, when parameters like magnitude and location on the sky are also considered. Using these multidimensional distributions, we compute the likelihood of a close pair of stars to be a chance alignment, resulting in a total(clean) catalog of 68,725(50,230) likely binaries within 200 pc with a completeness rate of ∼75%(∼64%) and contamination rate of ∼14%(∼0.4%). Within this, we find 590 previously unidentified binaries from Gaia eDR3 with projected physical separations &lt;30 au, where 138 systems were previously identified, and for s &lt; 10 au we find that 4 out of 15 new likely binaries have not yet been observed with high-resolution imaging. We also demonstrate the potential of our catalog to determine physical separation distributions and binary fraction estimates, from this increase in low-separation binaries. Overall, this catalog provides a good complement for the study of local binary populations by probing smaller physical separations and mass ratios, and provides prime targets for speckle monitoring.","astronomy"
"A special case of the generalized Schuster density law for stellar systems with spherical symmetry is discussed; here the exponent in the denominator is equal to i/2 where i is a positive integer. Special attention is paid to the situation 2 ? i ? 5 since then the mass distributions in almost all approximately spherical stellar systems and subsystems known to exist - e. g. dark coronae of galaxies, bulges and halos of spiral galaxies, as well as the systems with the classical Schuster density law - are included. With certain improvements one can also obtain more ample variants including the density continuously attaining zero at a finite radius, somewhat different descriptions of the mass distribution, as well as generalizations towards axial symmetry. It is shown among others, that a spheroid with this mass distribution (i=4) yields the same total mass as the exponential disc and that the mass distribution proposed by King belongs asymptotically to the generalized Schuster density law (i=3).","astronomy"
"We analyze significant X-ray, EUV, and UV emission coming from the dark side of Venus observed with Hinode/XRT and Solar Dynamics Observatory/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (SDO/AIA) during a transit across the solar disk that occurred in 2012. As a check we have analyzed an analogous Mercury transit that occurred in 2006. We have used the latest version of the Hinode/XRT point spread function to deconvolve Venus and Mercury X-ray images, to remove instrumental scattering. After deconvolution, the flux from Venus’ shadow remains significant while that of Mercury becomes negligible. Since stray light contamination affects the XRT Ti-poly filter data we use, we performed the same analysis with XRT Al-mesh filter data, not affected by the light leak. Even the latter data show residual flux. We have also found significant EUV (304 Å, 193 Å, 335 Å) and UV (1700 Å) flux in Venus’ shadow, measured with SDO/AIA. The EUV emission from Venus’ dark side is reduced, but still significant, when deconvolution is applied. The light curves of the average flux of the shadow in the X-ray, EUV, and UV bands appear different as Venus crosses the solar disk, but in any of them the flux is, at any time, approximately proportional to the average flux in a ring surrounding Venus, and therefore proportional to that of the solar regions around Venus’ obscuring disk line of sight. The proportionality factor depends on the band. This phenomenon has no clear origin; we suggest that it may be due to scatter occurring in the very long magnetotail of Venus.","astronomy"
"Estimator algorithms are immensely versatile and powerful tools that can be applied to any problem where a dynamic system can be modeled by a set of equations and where observations are available. A well designed estimator enables system states to be optimally predicted and errors to be rigorously quantified. Unscented Kalman filters (UKFs) and interactive multiple models can be found in methods from satellite tracking to self-driving cars. The luminous trajectory of the Bunburra Rockhole fireball was observed by the Desert Fireball Network in mid-2007. The recorded data set is used in this paper to examine the application of these two techniques as a viable approach to characterizing fireball dynamics. The nonlinear, single-body system of equations, used to model meteoroid entry through the atmosphere, is challenged by gross fragmentation events that may occur. The incorporation of the UKF within an interactive multiple model smoother provides a likely solution for when fragmentation events may occur as well as providing a statistical analysis of the state uncertainties. In addition to these benefits, another advantage of this approach is its automatability for use within an image processing pipeline to facilitate large fireball data analyses and meteorite recoveries.","astronomy"
"We present the discoveries of two giant plants orbiting the red-giant-branch star HD 112570 and the red-clump star HD 154391, based on the radial-velocity (RV) measurements from the Xinglong station and Okayama Astrophysical Observatory. Spectroscopic and asteroseismic analyses suggest that HD 112570 has a mass of 1.15 ± 0.12 M ☉, a radius of 9.85 ± 0.23 R ☉, a metallicity [Fe/H] of −0.46 ± 0.1, and log g of 2.47 ± 0.1. With the joint analysis of RV and Hipparcos-Gaia astrometry, we obtain a dynamical mass of M p = 3.42 − 0.84 + 1.4 M Jup , a period of P = 2615 − 77 + 85 days, and a moderate eccentricity of e = 0.20 − 0.14 + 0.16 for the Jovian planet HD 112570 b. For HD 154391, it has a mass of 2.07 ± 0.03 M ☉, a radius of 8.56 ± 0.05 R ☉, a metallicity [Fe/H] of 0.07 ± 0.1, and log g of 2.86 ± 0.1. The super-Jupiter HD 154391 b has a mass of M p = 9.1 − 1.9 + 2.8 M Jup , a period of P = 5163 − 57 + 60 days, and an eccentricity of e = 0.20 − 0.04 + 0.04 . We found that HD 154391 b has one of the longest orbital periods among those ever discovered orbiting evolved stars, which may provide a valuable case in our understanding of planetary formation at wider orbits. Moreover, while a mass gap at 4 M Jup seems to be present in the population of giant stars, there appear to be no significant differences in the distribution of metallicity among giant planets with masses above or below this threshold. Finally, the origin of the abnormal accumulation near 2 au for planets around large evolved stars (R ⋆ &gt; 21 R ☉), remains unclear.","astronomy"
"We present the discovery of TOI-1994b, a low-mass brown dwarf transiting a hot subgiant star on a moderately eccentric orbit. TOI-1994 has an effective temperature of 7700 − 410 + 720 K, V magnitude of 10.51 mag and log(g) of 3.982 − 0.065 + 0.067 . The brown dwarf has a mass of 22.1 − 2.5 + 2.6 M J, a period of 4.034 days, an eccentricity of 0.341 − 0.059 + 0.054 , and a radius of 1.220 − 0.071 + 0.082 R J. TOI-1994b is more eccentric than other transiting brown dwarfs with similar masses and periods. The population of low-mass brown dwarfs may have properties similar to planetary systems if they were formed in the same way, but the short orbital period and high eccentricity of TOI-1994b may contrast this theory. An evolved host provides a valuable opportunity to understand the influence stellar evolution has on the substellar companion’s fundamental properties. With precise age, mass, and radius, the global analysis and characterization of TOI-1994b augments the small number of transiting brown dwarfs and allows the testing of substellar evolution models.","astronomy"
"We reconsider the basic properties of the classical minihalo model of Rees and Milgrom in light of the new work, both observational (on 'dark galaxies' and masses of baryonic haloes) and theoretical (on the cosmological mass function and the history of star formation).

The II Peg colour- index shift in H-R diagram is probably a consequence of stellar metallicity. Other associated mechanisms are briefly discussed.","astronomy"

"We modified oscillator strengths and enhancement factors of van der Waals damping constants for 84 moderately strong and weak neutral iron spectral lines between 500 nm and 510 nm, by fitting the solar synthetic spectrum to the observed one. We have found significant difference between the oscillator strengths and damping constants taken from an extensive spectral line list, frequently used for spectral synthesis, and their modified values. Our findings include: (1) the mean value of the distribution of the difference between our and listed oscillator strengths is -0.31dex and its width is 0.42 dex, (2) a decrease of this difference with increasing equivalent width of spectral lines, (3) unusually high values of the obtained enhancement factors in comparison with the results of other authors, (4) a decrease of enhancement factor with increasing excitation potential for lines with equivalent width greater than 7.5 pm, (5) a decrease of enhancement factors with increasing equivalent width and (6) a decrease of enhancement factors with increasing oscillator strengths.","astronomy"
"We present 11 spectra from 12 candidate radio sources co-identified with known planetary nebulae (PNe) in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Originally found in Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) LMC surveys at 1.4, 4.8 and 8.64 GHz and confirmed by new high resolution ATCA images at 6 and 3 cm (4' /2' ), these complement data recently presented for candidate radio PNe in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). Their spectra were obtained using the Radcliff 1.9-meter telescope in Sutherland (South Africa). All of the optical PNe and radio candidates are within 2' and may represent a population of selected radio bright sample only. Nebular ionized masses of these objects are estimated to be as high as 1.8 Mfi, supporting the idea that massive PNe progenitor central stars lose much of their mass in the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase or prior. We also identify a sub-population (33%) of radio PNe candidates with prominent ionized iron emission lines.","astronomy"
"In this paper we study the problem of how to determine the coordinates of a point a telescope is directed to on the basis of data obtained from a 9DOF sensor board. On the 9DOF sensor board there are three sensors: the gyroscope, accelerometer and magnetometer. By combining the data from all the three sensors one obtains the Eulerian angles in the system tied to the sensor board. The Eulerian angles are transformed into the horizontal and equatorial coordinates in order to obtain the point the telescope is directed to.","astronomy"
"In this paper we present halo statistics analysis of a ?CDM N body cosmological simulation (from first halo formation until z = 0). We study mean major merger rate as a function of time, where for time we consider both per redshift and per Gyr dependence. For latter we find that it scales as the well known power law (1 + z)n for which we obtain n = 2.4. The halo mass function and halo growth function are derived and compared both with analytical and empirical fits. We analyse halo growth through out entire simulation, making it possible to continuously monitor evolution of halo number density within given mass ranges. The halo formation redshift is studied exploring possibility for a new simple preliminary analysis during the simulation run. Visualization of the simulation is portrayed as well. At redshifts z = 0?7 halos from simulation have good statistics for further analysis especially in mass range of 1011 ? 1014 M./h.","astronomy"
"The astrometric European Space Agency (ESA) Gaia mission was launched in December 19, 2013. One of the tasks of the Gaia mission is production of an astrometric catalog of over one billion stars and more than 500000 extragalactic sources. The quasars (QSOs), as extragalactic sources and radio emitters, are active galactic nuclei objects (AGNs) whose coordinates are well determined via Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) technique and may reach sub-milliarcsecond accuracy. The QSOs are the defining sources of the quasi-inertial International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF) because of their core radio morphology, negligible proper motions (until sub-milliarcsecond per year), and apparent point-like nature. Compact AGNs, visible in optical domain, are useful for a direct link of the future Gaia optical reference frame with the most accurate radio one. Apart from the above mentioned activities, Gaia has other goals such as follow-up of transient objects. One of the most important Gaia's requirements for photometric alerts is a fast observation and reduction response, that is, submition of observations within 24 hours. For this reason we have developed a pipeline. In line with possibilities of our new telescope (D(cm)/F(cm)=60/600) at the Astronomical Station Vidojevica (ASV, of the Astronomical Observatory in Belgrade), we joined the Gaia-Follow-Up Network for Transients Objects (Gaia-FUN-TO) for the photometric alerts. Moreover, in view of the cooperation with Bulgarian colleagues (in the frst place, SV), one of us (GD) initiated a local mini-network of Serbian { Bulgarian telescopes useful for the Gaia-FUN-TO and other astronomical purposes. During the next year we expect a new 1.4 m telescope at ASV site. The speed of data processing (from observation to calibration server) could be one day. Here, we present an overview of our activities in the Gaia-FUN-TO which includes establishing Serbian { Bulgarian mini-network (of five telescopes at three sites, ASV in Serbia, Belogradchik and Rozhen in Bulgaria), the Gaia-FUN-TO test observations, and some results.","astronomy"
"The past several decades have seen accelerating progress in improving binary stars fundamental parameters determinations, as new observational techniques have produced visual orbits of many spectroscopic binaries with a milli arcsecond precision. Modern astrometry is rapidly approaching the goal of sub-milli arcsecond precision, and although presently this precision has been achieved only for a limited number of binary stars, in the near future this will become a standard for very large number of objects. In this paper we review the representative results of techniques which have already allowed the sub-milli arcsecond precision like the optical long baseline interferometry, as well as the precursor techniques such as speckle interferometry, adaptive optics and aperture masking. These techniques provide a step forward from milli to sub-milli arcsecond precision, allowing even short period binaries to be resolved, and often resulting in orbits allowing precisions in stellar dynamical masses better than 1%. We point out that such unprecedented precisions should allow for a significant improvement of our comprehension of stellar physics and other related astrophysical topics.","astronomy"

"The electrons dynamics and the time autocorrelation function Cee(t) for the total electric microfield of the electrons on positive charge impurity embedded in a plasma are considered when the relativistic dynamic of the electrons is taken into account. We have, at first, built the effective potential governing the electrons dynamics. This potential obeys a nonlinear integral equation that we have solved numerically. Regarding the electron broadening of the line in plasma, we have found that when the plasma parameters change, the amplitude of the collision operator changes in the same way as the time integral of Cee(t). The electron-impurity interaction is taken at first time as screened Deutsh interaction and at the second time as Kelbg interaction. Comparisons of all interesting quantities are made with respect to the previous interactions as well as between classical and relativistic dynamics of electrons.","astronomy"
"It has recently been reported that some of the flux density values for an evolved supernova remnant (SNR) HB 3 (G132.7+1.3) are not accurate enough. In this work we therefore revised the analysis of the possible thermal emission at radio frequencies from this SNR using the recently published, corrected flux density values. A model including the sum of non-thermal (purely synchrotron) and thermal (bremsstrahlung) components is applied to fit the integrated radio spectrum of this SNR. The contribution of thermal component to the total volume emissivity at 1 GHz is estimated to be ? 37%. The ambient density is also estimated to be n ? 9 cm-3 for T = 104 K. Again we obtained a relatively significant presence of thermal emission at radio frequencies from the SNR, which can support interaction between SNR HB 3 and adjacent molecular cloud associated with the H ii region W3. Our model estimates for thermal component contribution to total volume emissivity at 1 GHz and ambient density are similar to those obtained earlier (? 40 %, ? 10 cm-3 ). It is thus obvious that the corrected flux density values do not affect the basic conclusions.","astronomy"
"We carried out light curve solutions of four detached binaries observed by Kepler. As a result, their orbital inclinations, temperatures and relative stellar radii were determined. KIC 10031409 and KIC 11228612 reveal partial eclipses while the components of KIC 11403216 and KIC 11913071 undergo total eclipses. The secondary component of KIC 11403216 is probably a very late M dwarf or brown dwarf. The out-of-eclipse brightness of KIC 10031409, KIC 11228612 and KIC 11913071 vary with the orbital period and might be explained by spots on synchronously-rotating star(s). The out-of-eclipse variability of KIC 11403216 is with a period that is a third of its orbital period and may be due to spot on asynchronous rotating component. The resonance 1:3 needs future study of KIC 11403216.","astronomy"

"The Gaia DR2 reference frame should be without relative rotation to the quasars (QSOs) and consistent with the International Celestial Reference System (ICRS). For the faint part of DR2 (stars with Gaia magnitude G ? 16) that task was done via Gaia's observations of QSOs (G ? 17 mag), but the bright DR2 (G ? 13 mag) is difficult to validate and it rotates relative to the faint DR2 at rate of the order of 0.1 mas/yr. Very bright DR2 stars (G ? 6 mag) mostly have inferior astrometry. Here, the aim is to determine two spin components (?X and ?Y ) of the bright DR2 using International Latitude Service (ILS, for 387 stars) and independent latitude stations (INDLS, for 682 stars) catalogs of proper motion in declination ??; both are referred to the Hipparcos reference frame and their stars are mostly from 4 to 8 mag in the V-band (critical part of DR2). Also, using the new Hipparcos (NHIP) values ?? for ILS and INDLS stars, we can see that the merit of the ILS and INDLS is the long time baseline (?t ? 90 years) important for ?? because the standard deviation of ?? is opposite to ?t. Applying the least squares method (LSM) to the differences of ?? between two catalogs (ILS-DR2, INDLS-DR2, etc.), our results support the mentioned spin. The 3? criterion and Tukey's fences method were used to reject some stars, the Abbe criterion to explain the variability in ILS-DR2 and other ?? differences, and the Shapiro-Wilk test to check the standard distribution of differences. The obtained ?? is significant at the 2? level, and the ILS and INDLS catalogs could be useful for validation of the bright reference frame of Gaia DR2.","astronomy"
"Gravitational waves (GW) in the nano-Hz domain are expected to be radiated by close-binaries of supermassive black holes (CB-SMBHs; components bound in a Keplerian binary at mutual distance less than ~ 0.1 pc), which are relicts of galaxy mergers and anticipated to be measured via the Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) technique. The challenge of present CB-SMBH investigations is that their signatures are elusive and not easily disentangled from a single SMBH. PTAs will typically have a glimpse of an early portion of the binary inspiral to catch the frequency evolution of the binary only with sufficiently high mass and initially high eccentricity. Thus, we have to make use of electromagnetic observations to determine orbital parameters of CB-SMBHs and test nano-Hz GW properties. The 2D reverberation mapping (RM) is a powerful tool for probing kinematics and geometry of ionized gas in the SMBHs (single or binary) vicinity, yet it can lose information due to projection on the line of sight of the observer. Nevertheless, spectroastrometry with AMBER, GRAVITY, and successors can provide an independent measurement of the emitting region's size, geometry, and kinematics. These two techniques combined can resolve CB-SMBHs. In this review, we focus on RM and spectroastrometry observational signatures of CB-SMBHs with non-zero eccentricity from recent simulations with particular attention to recent developments and open issues.","astronomy"
"Optical interferometry is entering a new age with several ground- based long-baseline observatories now making observations of unprecedented spatial resolution. Based on a great leap forward in the quality and quantity of interferometric data, the astrophysical applications are not limited anymore to classical subjects, such as determination of fundamental properties of stars; namely, their effective temperatures, radii, luminosities and masses, but the present rapid development in this field allowed to move to a situation where optical interferometry is a general tool in studies of many astrophysical phenomena. Particularly, the advent of long-baseline interferometers making use of very large pupils has opened the way to faint objects science and first results on extragalactic objects have made it a reality. The first decade of XXI century is also remarkable for aperture synthesis in the visual and near-infrared wavelength regimes, which provided image reconstructions from stellar surfaces to Active Galactic Nuclei. Here I review the numerous astrophysical results obtained up to date, except for binary and multiple stars milliarcsecond astrometry, which should be a subject of an independent detailed review, taking into account its importance and expected results at microarcsecond precision level. To the results obtained with currently available interferometers, I associate the adopted instrumental settings in order to provide a guide for potential users concerning the appropriate instruments which can be used to obtain the desired astrophysical information.","astronomy"
"AM CVn-type stars and ultra-compact X-ray binaries are extremely interesting semi-detached close binary systems in which the Roche lobe filling component is a white dwarf transferring mass to another white dwarf, neutron star or a black hole. Earlier theoretical considerations show that there is a maximum mass ratio of AM CVn-type binary systems (qmax ? 2/3) below which the mass transfer is stable. In this paper we derive slightly different value for qmax and more interestingly, by applying the same procedure, we find the maximum expected white dwarf mass in ultra-compact X-ray binaries.","astronomy"

The motion equations and the first integrals of energy and angular momentum are established. The McGehee-type coordinates are used to blow up the collision singularity and to paste the resulting manifold on the phase space. The flow on the collision manifold is depicted. Then, using the rotational symmetry of the problem and the angular momentum integral, the local flow near collision is described and interpreted in terms of physical motion.","astronomy"

"This study in the philosophy of cosmology is a part of an ongoing effort to investigate and reassess the importance of the anthropic (Davies-Tipler) argument against cosmologies containing the past temporal infinity. Obviously the prime targets of this argument are cosmological models stationary on sufficiently large scale, the classical steady state model of Bondi, Gold and Hoyle being the best example. Here we investigate the extension of application of this argument to infinitely old non-stationary models and discuss additional constraints necessary to be imposed on such models for the edge of the anthropic argument to be preserved. An illustrative counterexample is the classical Eddington-Lemaitre model, in the analysis of which major such constraints are presented. Consequences of such an approach for our understanding of the nature of time are briefly discussed.","astronomy"
"In order to find reliable Stark width data, needed in plasma spectroscopy comparision between the existing measured, calculated and predicted Stark width values was performed for ten singly ionized emitters: C, N, O, F, Ne Si, P, S, Cl and Ar in the lower lying 3s - 3p, 3p - 3d and 4s - 4p transitions. These emitters are present in many cosmic light sources. On the basis of the agreement between mentioned values 17 spectral lines from six singly ionized spectra have been recommended, for the first time, for plasma spectroscopy as spectral lines with reliable Stark width data. Critical analysis of the existing Stark width data is also given.","astronomy"

"In this work we expand the previous discussion of the plausibility of hypothesis of origin of the Ly? forest absorption systems in haloes of normal galaxies in connection with the HubbleDeepField (HDF) data. It is shown that simplistic approach to absorption cross-sections of galaxies with no luminosity scaling is in strong violation of empirical statistics up to redshift of z ? 3.5. Realistic variation of the covering factor in order to account for its increase in the inner parts of observed haloes leads to even bigger discrepancy. Cosmologies with finite cosmological constant are briefly discussed and compared to ? = 0 case. Ways to improve agreement with observational data are indicated. This problem is highly illustrative of the basic tenets of modern observational cosmology.","astronomy"
"The rotation of a test spiral galaxy with two contributors - the disc and the corona - is considered. The disc is exponential, whereas the corona is the dark subsystem. For the latter several variants of mass distribution are considered. It is found that the homogeneous sphere is almost unavoidable if the circular velocity has a continuous increase, at least in its observable part. On the other hand the rather often applied quasi-isothermal law offers the most satisfactory fit for the case of constant circular velocity though the classical Schuster law may also be used, especially taking into account its simplicity and the consequent possibility of generalising its potential towards the more general case of axial symmetry.","astronomy"

APOLLO measures the Earth–Moon separation by recording the round-trip travel time of photons from the Apache Point Observatory to five retro-reflector arrays on the Moon. The APOLLO data set, combined with the 50 yr archive of measurements from other lunar laser ranging (LLR) stations, can be used to probe fundamental physics such as gravity and Lorentz symmetry, as well as properties of the Moon itself.

"We present an algorithm that mitigates the effects of charge migration due to the “brighter-fatter effect” (BFE) that occurs for highly illuminated stars in the Teledyne HAWAII-2RG detectors used in the NIRCam, NIRISS, and NIRSpec science instruments aboard the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). The impact of this effect is most significant for photometry and spectrophotometry of bright stars in data for which the point-spread function (PSF) is undersampled, which is the case for several observing modes of the NIRISS instrument. The main impact of BFE to NIRISS data is incorrect count rate determinations for pixels in the central regions of PSFs of bright stars due to jump detections that are caused by charge migration from peak pixels to surrounding pixels. The effect is especially significant for bright compact sources in resampled, distortion-free images produced by the drizzle algorithm: quantitatively, apparent flux losses of &gt;50% can occur in such images due to BFE. We describe the algorithm of the “charge_migration” mitigation step that has been implemented in version 10.0 of the operational JWST calibration pipeline as of 2023 December 5. We illustrate the impact of this step in terms of the resulting improvements of the precision of imaging photometry of point sources. The algorithm renders the effects of BFE on photometry and surface brightness measurements to stay within 1%.","astronomy"
"For the astronomical adaptive optics systems, the observation condition is always in a regime of low photon flux. We present a method of superimposing subapertures for the Shark–Hartmann wave front sensing with faint objects. This approach significantly improves the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of the spot pattern by superimposing adjacent subapertures, thus circumventing the invalid wave front sensing with faint object, enhancing the accuracy of the wave front detection. In addition, we demonstrate that the validity of this approach is not an incidental result under a specific condition, which can be explained theoretically by exploiting the atmospheric turbulence model. Then we validate the approach with simulations and experimental realization under weak-light and bright-light conditions. Results show that the proposed subaperture superposition approach can achieve accurate wave front reconstruction for low S/N or faint object even in cases beyond the ability of conventional methods. It brings out a new idea, besides long exposure and variable sampling, that comes with a tradeoff between temporal sampling frequency and spatial resolution. In addition, this method is also valid for extended objects; we preliminarily validate this method on a 600 mm aperture solar telescope, achieving stable closed-loop control with lower-contrast objects.","astronomy"
"We describe a citizen science asteroid detection system developed by the International Astronomical Search Collaboration (IASC) and the Institute for Astronomy at the University of Hawaii, utilizing data from the Pan-STARRS telescopes. The goals of this project are to (i) educate and engage citizen scientists (mostly high school students) in science and astronomy, (ii) search for new asteroids to extend the limiting magnitudes of existing asteroid surveys, and (iii) find missed Near-Earth Objects (NEOs—objects with perihelia q &lt; 1.3 au) to support planetary defense efforts. Over the past 15 yr, 50,000 citizen scientists from 96 countries around the world have detected ∼12,000 main-belt asteroids and ∼5 NEOs. Citizen scientists use the software Astrometrica during scheduled campaigns to search for and measure asteroid astrometry and photometry, and submit the data to IASC for vetting. Candidate detections not already submitted by Pan-STARRS are then submitted to the Minor Planet Center, and are typically ∼0.30 ± 0.07 mag fainter.","astronomy"
"NASA’s TESS mission yields light curves for tens of millions of stars spread across the entire sky, a data set that will be a challenge to fully exploit without help from citizen scientists. To address this, we launched a new citizen science project, called “Planet Patrol”, designed to analyze TESS data on exoplanet and eclipsing binary candidates. The project will also serve to benchmark different data reduction pipelines and help analyze unusual light curves that might defeat automated algorithms. The first stage of the project ran on the Zooniverse platform between 2020 September and November and involved more than 5500 registered volunteers. The Planet Patrol citizen scientists produced nearly 400,000 classifications of difference images used for photocenter analysis of about 1000 planet candidates from TESS. The results were incorporated into the photocenter module of the Discovery And Vetting of Exoplanets (DAVE) pipeline to improve its reliability. Specifically, the classifications indicated that all per-transit difference images are appropriate for photocenter analysis for about 40% of the planet candidates, and the corresponding measurements are sound. In contrast, the volunteers found that all per-transit difference images are dominated by astrophysical contamination and/or systematic effects for about 10% of the planet candidates. This indicated that the corresponding photocenter measurements are unreliable. Finally, the fraction of images appropriate for photocenter analysis varies between 0 and 1 for half the candidates. Removing the images classified as poor from DAVE’s analysis of most of these candidates helped reduce the corresponding photocenter uncertainty by up to ∼30%. We plan to implement the output from another module of DAVE, designed for lightcurve vetting, into a second stage of the Planet Patrol project.","astronomy"
"This article considers whether political science should abandon the subfields of American politics, comparative politics, and international relations (IR), for new subfields of conflict, political economy, institutions, and behavior. The focus here is whether the field should abandon IR. The article lays out the arguments in favor of abandoning IR, describing scholarly trends that cross conventional subfield lines and are pushing to dissolve IR. Next, it argues that the costs of abandoning IR exceed the benefits, as new subfield divisions would remove some artificial walls but create new ones. Abandoning IR might undermine objective theory testing, would disadvantage the study of international system and structure, and would undermine the ability of political science to inform foreign policy debates. The article concludes by recommending that the field keep IR and its current subfield boundaries but that the walls between subfields should be kept low and porous.","political_science"
"In the field of international political economy, workers are commonly analyzed as objects of global economic forces whose fate is determined by the profit-seeking behaviors of firms and governments. Workers, however, can also assert themselves to protect their rights, and they can emigrate to other countries to find employment. We analyze the literature on the nexus between the international economy and labor with a focus on workers on both the receiving and originating ends of global finance. Beginning with workers as inputs in multinational production, we explore the roles of economic openness, factor endowments, government policy, and unionization as drivers of workers' rights. We then shift to workers as migrant labor and explore the impact of migrants' own cross-border financial transfers—also known as remittances—on political outcomes in their home countries. Our overview not only highlights tremendous progress in explaining the agency and vulnerability of labor in the global economy but also reveals significant weaknesses in recent research, especially a mismatch between micro-level theorizing and macro-level data analysis.","political_science"
"Does democracy matter for normatively desirable outcomes? We survey results from 1,100 cross-country analyses drawn from 600 journal articles published after the year 2000. These analyses are conducted on 30 distinct outcomes pertaining to social policy, economic policy, citizenship and human rights, military and criminal justice, and overall governance. Across these diverse outcomes, most studies report either a positive or null relationship with democracy. However, there is evidence of threshold bias, suggesting that reported findings may reflect a somewhat exaggerated image of democracy's effects. Additionally, democratic effects are more likely to be found for outcomes that are easily attained than for those that lie beyond the reach of government but are often of great normative importance. We also find that outcomes measured by subjective indicators show a stronger positive relationship with democracy than outcomes that are measured or proxied by more objective indicators.","political_science"

We also highlight a growing body of scholarship that examines the racial and gender differences in emotion's ability to affect political behavior. We conclude with a discussion of unaddressed questions and suggestions for future directions for scholars working in this area of growing importance.","political_science"
"Apart from some notable exceptions, education is regrettably understudied in comparative politics. This paucity stems from both a dearth of reliable data on schooling and the fact that education raises analytical issues that fall outside the typical domain of political scientists. In light of education's crucial role in everything from citizen attitudes to earnings to economic growth, we recommend that political scientists pay more attention to education. In particular, comparative researchers should shift from an almost exclusive focus on average levels of schooling to explaining the causes and consequences of educational inequality. To that end, we provide a broad comparative framework for analyzing the politics of education. In our formulation, skill-biased technological change and factor endowments condition the extent to which firms demand human capital. The supply of skills is a function of the interests and institutions that link voters and politicians. We conclude by positing theoretical and empirical puzzles for future research.","political_science"
"Owning a house is the most important economic choice most families will ever make. Yet, our understanding of the political causes and consequences of homeownership is rather thin. This review argues that political scientists need to take housing much more seriously, not least because of the unprecedented surges and collapses of house prices over the past two decades. The housing market is both a proxy for and a cause of growing social cleavages that shape how citizens view political issues from the size of the welfare state to the attractiveness of populist campaigns. The article begins by re-examining classic work on property from the nineteenth century as a still-relevant guide to the winners and losers from property market shocks and regulations. It then turns to the postwar era and work that suggests that the welfare state and property ownership are in some sense substitutes. It concludes by examining the role housing plays in shaping contemporary political preferences, both as a direct measure of individuals' wealth and welfare and as a proxy for the relative fortunes of different places.","political_science"
"Although understanding the role of race, ethnicity, and identity is central to political science, methodological debates persist about whether it is possible to estimate the effect of something immutable. At the heart of the debate is an older theoretical question: Is race best understood under an essentialist or constructivist framework? In contrast to the “immutable characteristics” or essentialist approach, we argue that race should be operationalized as a “bundle of sticks” that can be disaggregated into elements. With elements of race, causal claims may be possible using two designs: (a) studies that measure the effect of exposure to a racial cue and (b) studies that exploit within-group variation to measure the effect of some manipulable element. These designs can reconcile scholarship on race and causation and offer a clear framework for future research.","political_science"
"The failure to anticipate the collapse of communist one-party systems stands in striking contrast to the determinism of retrospective accounts. This essay reviews accounts of the decay and breakdown of one-party systems in order to uncover the causes behind political science's inability to both anticipate these developments and provide satisfactory explanations. These causes include the deterministic character of most accounts, the absence of a theory of single-party rule, the absence or misspecification of causal links between the major building blocks of the arguments put forth, and the analytic conflation of decay and breakdown. Understanding the decay and breakdown of one-party systems requires a methodologically conscious distinction between these two processes and a specification of their links (and the links between the variables affecting each process), grounded in a theory of single-party rule.","political_science"
"Political science traditionally has either ignored biology in favor of purely environmental explanations for political phenomena or merely ruminated about the likely role of biology, leaving data-based research on biopolitics in dangerously short supply. Currently, attention to the apparent genetic basis for political and social orientations holds the greatest promise of advancing empirical biopolitics. Thus, in this essay, we orient behavior genetics research in the larger framework of biology and politics, confront its normative implications, describe the techniques involved, assess the strengths and weaknesses of commonly employed data and procedures, and describe the next steps in this research stream. Because these next steps involve molecular genetic work, we provide some background genetic information, but we mainly urge political scientists to join interdisciplinary teams so that nature and nurture can both be employed in ongoing efforts to understand the sources of mass-scale human politics.","political_science"

"Although the rest of the American politics subfield has taken up many of the research challenges that LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender) politics poses, there has been very little attention to LGBT politics within APD (American political development). Yet LGBT politics has deeply developmental and “state-centered” dynamics. Until the middle of the twentieth century, sexual orientation was simply not widely and deeply politicized in the United States. But abruptly, in a period of a decade and a half (roughly 1940–1955), national political and bureaucratic actors created a national sexuality regime that has taken 60 years of LGBT struggle to partly reverse. In seeking to substitute a different, overtly inclusive sexuality regime, LGBT citizens and their straight allies have initiated far-reaching changes in public policy, regulation of the workplace, and the institution of marriage. American politics has thus been developed by LGBT politics—and in the process, a fruitful research agenda has emerged.","political_science"
"Negotiation is a central activity in international affairs, but it tends to be studied indirectly through particular cases. Considering it as a subject in itself brings out some important principles. The general literature on negotiation falls into five categories: advice from practitioners, studies of particular cases or contexts, statistical tests of data, psychological theories with experiments, and game theory models. Each approach complements the others, but there has been too little interaction among them. Game models, in particular, are important for the international context, which involves more planning and more experienced actors. They resist the generalizations to which other approaches are prone, often showing that whether a move is well-advised or mistaken depends on some easy-to-overlook detail.","political_science"
"Scholars studying Hugo Chávez and his movement are generally divided into two camps: a liberal one that sees Chavismo as an instance of democratic backsliding and a radical one that upholds Chavismo as the fulfillment of its aspirations for participatory democracy.

The result has been a less productive body of scholarly work on both sides.","political_science"
"This review critically evaluates the largely consensual view that wars naturally and reflexively augment presidential power. After summarizing the key arguments advanced by presidency scholars in the aftermath of World War II, this article canvasses the existing empirical basis for their claims and the theoretical microfoundations upon which they are offered. Both appear wanting. Few systematic studies yield unambiguous evidence that the adjoining branches of government reliably support elements of the president's domestic or foreign policy agendas during war that they otherwise would oppose. And no one, to date, has offered a clear theory explaining why either Congress or the courts would behave in this way. The article therefore calls for continued empirical research on the causal effects of war on presidential power, and for renewed investments in theories that might account for the ways in which war figures into congressional and judicial voting.","political_science"
"Throughout my life, politics and political science have been intertwined. I handed out leaflets for Adlai Stevenson at age 12, participated in protests at Oberlin and Berkeley, and, as I developed professional expertise, worked with national security agencies. Conflict has been a continuing interest, particularly whether situations are best analyzed as a security dilemma or aggression. In exploring this question, I was drawn into both political psychology and signaling, although the two are very different. I have continued to work on each and occasionally try to bring them together. My thinking about strategic interaction led to a book-length exploration of system effects, a way of thinking that I believe is still insufficiently appreciated in the discipline and among policy makers. My research continues to be stimulated by both developments in the discipline and unfolding international politics.","political_science"
"Recent work has documented an upward trend in inequality since the 1970s that harks back to the Gilded Age: the inegalitarian pre–World War I world. Most prominently, Thomas Piketty argues in Capital in the Twenty-First Century that this is partially due to the fact that capitalism is hardwired to exacerbate the gap between the rich and poor. By critically evaluating recent literature on this topic, this article offers three big contributions. First, we advance an alternative explanation for the long-term U-shaped nature of inequality that Piketty examines. Political regime types and the social groups they empower, rather than war and globalization, can account for the sharp fall and then sharp rise in inequality over the long 20th century. Second, we demonstrate that this U-shaped pattern only really holds for a handful of industrialized economies and a subset of developing countries. Finally, we provide a unified framework centered on two unorthodox assumptions that can explain inequality patterns beyond the U-shaped one. Capitalists and landholders actually prefer democracy if they can first strike a deal that protects them after transition. This is because dictators are not the loyal servants of the economic elite they are portrayed to be—in fact, they are often responsible for soaking, if not destroying, the rich under autocracy.","political_science"
"New works by five young political scientists are establishing a new paradigm for studying judicial review. In different ways, Terri Peretti, Ran Hirschl, George Lovell, Kevin McMahon, and Thomas Keck point out that judicial review is established and maintained by elected officials. Adjudication is one of many means that politicians and political movements employ when seeking to make their constitutional visions the law of the land. Elected officials provide vital political foundations for judicial power by creating constitutional courts, vesting those courts with jurisdiction over constitutional questions, staffing those courts with judges prone to exercising judicial power, assisting or initiating litigation aimed at having those courts declare laws unconstitutional, and passing legislation that encourages justices to make public policy in the guise of statutory or constitutional interpretation. Judicial review does not serve to thwart or legitimate popular majorities; rather, it is a practice that alters the balance of power between the numerous political movements that struggle for power in a pluralist democracy.","political_science"
"We review arguments and empirical evidence in the comparative literature that bear on the differences in the survival rates of parliamentary and presidential democracies. Most of these arguments focus on the fact that presidential democracies are based on the separation of executive and legislative powers, whereas parliamentary democracies are based on the fusion of these powers. The implications of this basic distinction lead to radically different behavior and outcomes under each regime. We argue that this perspective is misguided and that one cannot deduce the functioning of the political system from the way governments are formed. Other provisions, constitutional and otherwise, also affect the way parliamentary and presidential democracies operate, and these provisions may counteract some of the tendencies that we would expect to observe if we derived the regime's performance from its basic constitutional principle.","political_science"
"Authoritarianism, it seems, is alive and well these days. The Trump administration's blatant dismissal of democratic norms has many wondering whether it fits the authoritarian model. This review offers a framework for understanding authoritarianism in the American past, as well as the American present. Starting in the early twentieth century, this analysis seeks to provide a better understanding of how authoritarianism once existed in enclaves in the Jim Crow South, where it was intended to dominate blacks in the wake of emancipation. Confining the definition of authoritarianism to regime rule, however, leaves little room for a discussion of more contemporary authoritarianism, at the micro level. This review shifts focus to an assessment of political psychology's concept of authoritarianism and how it ultimately drives racism. Ultimately, we believe a tangible connection exists between racism and authoritarianism. Even so, we question the mechanism. Along the way, we also discuss the ways in which communities of color, often the targets of authoritarianism, resist the intolerance to which they have been exposed. We conclude with a discussion of why we believe, despite temporal and spatial differences as well as incongruous levels of analysis, that micro- and macro-level authoritarianism have much in common.","political_science"
"This article reviews the cumulation of evidence from survey experiments in the field of international political economy (IPE) and discusses their strengths and weaknesses in explaining the backlash against globalization. I first review the advancements made by the most commonly used survey experiment design in IPE, namely the Globalization-as-Treatment design, in which scholars randomly assign information about different features of globalization and solicit respondents’ attitudes toward protectionism. Then I discuss three issues with this design in addressing key puzzles in the emergence of globalization backlash: ( a) using a coarse informational treatment that stacks the deck against the economic self-interest hypothesis; ( b) overattributing globalization as a source of hardship; and ( c) neglecting heterogeneous room-to-maneuver beliefs across and within countries. The article suggests alternative designs and strategies to study these questions. Evidence from survey experiments suggests that much of the globalization backlash we witness today is deeply rooted in domestic politics.","political_science"
"After reviewing the current literature on the causes of economic inequality, the article models the historical emergence of inequality as the result of a key technological change (i.e., the adoption of agriculture) that widened income differentials and led to the construction of state institutions, which shaped (depending on their particular nature, more or less authoritarian) the final distribution of economic assets within and across different societies. The article then explores the evolution of inequality in societies already endowed with state structures: A stream of biased technological shocks happens randomly and the “decisive” voter (who differs across political regimes) accepts or blocks them as a function of their effect on her net income. The decisive voter's response determines the overall distribution of income. The model is employed to give a coherent account of some broad historical trends in the evolution of income inequality.","political_science"
"Rulemaking is a critical part of American government and governance. This article reviews the political underpinnings of modern rulemaking. Specifically, it highlights the process and impact of agency regulations, as well as the key tools used by the legislature, elected executive, and courts to oversee the rulemaking process. The article also reviews who participates in the rulemaking process, as well as who influences regulatory content. Finally, new directions in regulatory policymaking are explored, including data collection advancements, as well as the potential role for guidance documents as replacements for more traditionally issued notice and comment regulations.","political_science"
"Most of my work focused on the functioning and the limits of democracy. I place the evolution of our understanding of this bewildering institution in the context of historical events and consider the challenges posed by its current critics.

"Kenneth J. Arrow was one of the most important intellectuals of the twentieth century, and his “impossibility theorem” is arguably the starting point of modern, axiomatic social choice theory. In this review, we begin with a brief discussion of Arrow's theorem and subsequent work that extended the result. We then discuss its implications for voting and constitutional systems, including a number of seminal results—both positive and negative—that characterize what such systems can accomplish and why. We then depart from this narrow interpretation of the result to consider more varied institutional design questions such as apportionment and geographical districting. Following this, we address the theorem's implications for measurement of concepts of fundamental interest to political science such as justice and inequality. Finally, we address current work applying social choice concepts and the axiomatic method to data analysis more generally.","political_science"
"Does foreign aid build peace? The answer is of paramount importance for policy makers and practitioners, given that the world's poor are growing increasingly concentrated in conflict-affected countries. Scholars have also demonstrated keen interest, primarily examining the relationship between foreign aid and civil wars. This review takes stock of the existing literature through a survey of key theoretical arguments connecting aid to the onset, dynamics, and recurrence of civil wars. It then articulates a key challenge posed by undertheorization of aid allocation, which is largely nonrandom, making the causal effects difficult to infer. I identify five areas in need of greater attention: microfoundational theoretical assumptions about aid flows; aid in the context of other foreign policy options; explicit articulation of other factors that may mediate or moderate aid's effects; levels of observation and aggregation; and measurement.","political_science"
"What role do business leaders play in American democracy? The dominant narrative in political science holds that business leaders have disproportionate influence; this influence has increased over time; the public opposes business engagement in politics; and a reform agenda could counteract business influence. I contrast this narrative with a second narrative that also emerges from the literature: Business leaders are fragmented and fail to achieve many of their goals; their power has weakened over time; the public wants more business engagement with politics, not less; and no viable reform agenda would fundamentally alter business power. The juxtaposed narratives reveal several insights, including a profound ambivalence among the public about the role of business in democracy. Survey evidence confirms that Democrats in particular are both especially opposed to and especially supportive of business engagement in politics, indicative of the veracity of the competing narratives.","political_science"
"Opposition to economic liberalization has intensified since the late 1990s, with Latin America often standing at the forefront of new social and political movements that challenge market globalization. The revival of social protest and populist or leftist political alternatives has shattered the technocratic consensus around neoliberal policies in the region. By demanding an expanded set of social citizenship rights, these movements are also contesting the terms under which popular sectors were reincorporated politically under the new democratic regimes of the 1980s. This “second” historical process of mass political incorporation differs in fundamental ways from that associated with the process of labor incorporation in the first half of the twentieth century. It is marked by a more pluralistic set of social subjects, a more decentralized organizational structure, and more fluid patterns of institutional development. Existing scholarship often fails to explain variation in the patterns of social and political mobilization, due to both methodological and theoretical limitations—in particular, a tendency to focus on outcomes with little variation on the dependent variable, and a failure to engage theoretically with the literature on social fragmentation and demobilization. There is thus a need to problematize the process of mobilization by conducting more rigorous comparative research on a broader range of social responses to market liberalization.","political_science"
"Theories that link domestic politics, domestic institutional structures, and leader incentives to foreign affairs have flowered in the past 25 years or so. By unpacking institutional variation across states and by drawing attention to agency issues between leaders, key backers, and citizens, models and empirical studies of linkage help explain even such fundamental phenomena between states as war and peace. In addition, theories of linkage politics explain phenomena not envisioned under earlier unitary-actor state models. We address how the linkage literature explains war and peace decisions, the democratic peace, nation building, foreign aid, and economic sanctions by tying international politics and foreign policy to domestic political considerations.","political_science"
"The article examines the emergence and implications of comparative political theory (CPT). It distinguishes theorizing based on travel and observation from that based on contemplation. Tracing the rise of the term CPT to 1997, it explains the academic, geopolitical, and cultural transformations that gave rise to some of the earlier work in the field. The acceleration of globalization also led to the rapid appearance of new intercultural and transnational approaches to political theory that move beyond the West. The article proceeds to analyze the methodological variety and alternatives within CPT work, arguing that we ought to take a broad, ecumenical approach to non-Western and cross-cultural theorizing rather than posit one single method as best. It presents two broad categories of CPT, one that is normative and another that is interpretive. The article closes by examining regional contributions in CPT, critiques, and supporting stances for CPT.","political_science"
"The question of what the ancient Greeks can tell us about democracy can be answered by reference to three fields that have traditionally been pursued with little reference to one another: ancient history, classical political theory, and political science. These fields have been coming into more fruitful contact over the past 20 years, as evidenced by a spate of interdisciplinary work. Historians, political theorists, and political scientists interested in classical Greek democracy are increasingly capable of leveraging results across disciplinary lines. As a result, the classical Greek experience has more to tell us about the origins and definition of democracy, and about the relationships between participatory democracy and formal institutions, rhetoric, civic identity, political values, political criticism, war, economy, culture, and religion.","political_science"
"Persuasion is a vital part of politics—who wins elections and policy disputes often depends on which side can persuade more people. Given this centrality, the study of persuasion has a long history with an enormous number of theories and empirical inquiries. However, the literature is fragmented, with few generalizable findings. I unify previously disparate dimensions of this topic by presenting a framework focusing on actors (speakers and receivers), treatments (topics, content, media), outcomes (attitudes, behaviors, emotions, identities), and settings (competition, space, time, process, culture). This Generalizing Persuasion (GP) Framework organizes distinct findings and offers researchers a structure in which to situate their work. I conclude with a discussion of the normative implications of persuasion.","political_science"
"In this review, we focus on political inequality in rich democracies. In the two main sections, we look at participation and representation, respectively. The former discusses whether rising income inequality and the weakening of trade unions have led to higher levels of inequality in participation. The latter looks at substantive and descriptive representation and asks how they might be linked. Research highlights that people with fewer individual resources participate much less than those with more resources, and collective organizations lose their ability to counter these trends. In terms of representation, the pattern is very similar. Not only are the opinions of decision-makers more congruent with those of the better off but policy choices also reflect their preferences more clearly. As the social distance between rulers and ruled increases, representative democracy gets more biased in favor of higher-status social groups.","political_science"
"The past three decades have witnessed the development of a rich literature that applies the formal tools of game theory to understanding international cooperation and international institutions. We divide this literature into three “generations” of scholarship. With a few notable exceptions, the first generation used very simple models—2×2 normal form games—to understand why states need to cooperate and why they comply with their cooperative agreements under conditions of anarchy. This first generation unfortunately bogged down in the neorealist–neoliberal debate. Second-generation scholars began to use tailor-made models to address the neorealist–neoliberal debate and to turn to new questions, such as how international agreements are created and how domestic political divisions affect international cooperation. With answers to the key questions of how international agreements are created and complied with, third-generation scholars could turn to increasingly refined models to answer specific questions about international institutions, such as the proper size of multilateral agreements, how the gains of cooperation are distributed, whether flexibility provisions should be built into agreements, and the specific functions of international organizations.","political_science"
"Although the study of realignment is an essential component of the rich and fruitful tradition of examining long-term partisan change, questions about the usefulness of the concept persist. We seek to redirect and reinvigorate the study of lasting political change by evaluating the critiques of classic realignment theory, examining the issue evolution perspective, and assessing whether the theory of issue evolution can be used to explain recent research on the relationship between political issues and partisan change. Our review of the theoretical and empirical literature investigating political issues and party alignments sheds light on both the utility of the issue evolution perspective and the conditions under which durable changes in party alignments are most likely to occur.","political_science"
"This article surveys the rationales for and effects of legislative bicameralism. At heart, second chambers facilitate representation for groups or interests that otherwise might be ignored. They do so not only by making more legislative seats available to legislators elected from different districts and possibly by different rules, but more importantly by giving more legislators a voice in the legislative process. Traditional views of bicameralism hold that second chambers can matter because their members have the authority to veto or at least delay bills, so that whether they do in fact affect legislative content depends on whether and to what extent majority preferences differ across chambers. A new current of legislative research focuses on how the existence of a second chamber provides a forum for bargaining over policy and, in the process, creates a need for policy bargains within parties as well as across chamber majorities that would be unnecessary in a unicameral legislature.","political_science"
"The Great Recession that began in late 2007 had devastating consequences for the fiscal health of state and local governments, and many remain in a precarious financial position. Several cities have declared bankruptcy, and more will do so in coming years. The future, however, promises no long-term relief. Due primarily to the aging population of the United States, state and local governments are allocating large and increasing shares of their budgets to expenditures on Medicaid and on retirement benefits that they have promised to their past and current employees. As these expenditures consume more of their budgets, there is less to spend on transportation, parks and recreation, education, public safety, and all the other services that these governments provide. We are thus experiencing the onset of a New Fiscal Ice Age, a period in which a given level of tax revenue purchases a considerably lower level of current services.","political_science"
"The study of interstate rivalry, which has made major contributions to theory and research on war, is reviewed, and new research on the role of territory in the origin and war proneness of rivalries is presented. Recent research has shown that states that are rivals are much more likely to go to war than are other states, and that about half the wars fought since 1815 have involved states that are rivals. This review describes the origins of interstate rivalries in terms of whether they begin over territorial disputes, policy disputes, or disputes over the nature of a state's regime. It finds that states that dispute territory have a greater probability of becoming rivals than expected by chance, compared with states that dispute other issues. It also investigates the extent to which territorial disputes and the recurring of disputes, despite their content, are related to the onset of war.","political_science"
"This paper surveys three sources of conflict about citizenship and education in contemporary normative political theory: the extent to which rival conceptions of citizenship differ in the ends they prescribe for civic education; disagreement about the educational processes needed to yield accepted civic educational ends and how some of those processes might best be institutionalized via schooling; and disagreement about how liberal legitimacy constrains state action undertaken for the sake of democratic education.","political_science"
"Neopluralism is one of a class of research findings or social science models—such as elitism, pluralism, and corporatism—that refer to the structure of power and policy making in some domain of public policy. Originating from Robert Dahl's pluralism model in Who Governs? (1961), neopluralism evolved in the study of American politics through discarding or modifying some of Dahl's ideas, while adding new concerns about agenda building, the logic of collective action, special-interest subgovernments, social movements, advocacy coalitions, and the theory of political processes. Neopluralism is normally a finding of complex action in policy systems, but neopluralism does not assume that complexity implies fairness of representation, nor does it assume interest group elimination of autonomous action by governmental agencies.","political_science"
"Policy makers pay relatively little attention to the vast theoretical literature in IR, and many scholars seem uninterested in doing policy-relevant work. These tendencies are unfortunate because theory is an essential tool of statecraft. Many policy debates ultimately rest on competing theoretical visions, and relying on a false or flawed theory can lead to major foreign policy disasters. Theory remains essential for diagnosing events, explaining their causes, prescribing responses, and evaluating the impact of different policies. Unfortunately, the norms and incentives that currently dominate academia discourage many scholars from doing useful theoretical work in IR. The gap between theory and policy can be narrowed only if the academic community begins to place greater value on policy-relevant theoretical work.","political_science"

I then analyze how the Communist Party of China attempts to promote Confucianism in order to consolidate its authoritarian rule and what damage this may cause to resurgent Confucianism. Finally, I evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of each approach and suggest some areas of interest for further exploration.","political_science"
"Mayhew's (1974) thesis regarding the “electoral connection” and its impact on legislative behavior has become the theoretical foundation for much of the research on the contemporary U.S. Congress. Recently, scholars have begun to suggest that the Mayhewian electoral incentive may apply to politics in earlier congressional eras as well. To assess these claims more systematically, we consider four conditions that serve as the building blocks of the electoral connection—ambition, autonomy, responsiveness, and accountability. Through a detailed review of the literature on electoral politics in Congress, we discover that all four conditions were present in a strict sense as far back as the Progressive Era. Moreover, considerable evidence suggests that a weaker, less formalized version of the electoral connection existed even earlier in American history. We conclude by briefly discussing the implications of these findings on the rapidly growing literature examining the historical and institutional evolution of Congress.","political_science"
"Theories of political economy offer rich intellectual resources for scholars today who hope to explain some of the most striking real-world changes of contemporary American politics, including the dramatic widening of economic inequality since the 1970s, the financial and economic breakdowns since 2008, and the government policies that contributed to these developments. Yet few scholars in American politics have been making use of these resources. This article reviews research on the politics of inequality within the United States and situates it more explicitly within an intellectual framework for the study of political economy. The article traces the decline of political economy research within mainstream scholarship on American politics and reviews the upsurge of interest in the politics of inequality. It develops a typology of distinct frameworks for analyzing the American political economy and for bringing greater intellectual organization to a growing but disparate body of research.","political_science"
"The eighteenth-century ideal of self-government of the people was based on an assumption that renders it incoherent and unrealistic, namely, that interests and values are sufficiently harmonious that each individual needs to obey only himself while living under laws chosen by all. This conception collapses in the presence of heterogeneous preferences.

I define this second-best self-government and analyze whether democratic institutions can satisfy even this definition.","political_science"
"The structure of international monetary relations has gained increasing prominence over the past two decades. Both national exchange rate policy and the character of the international monetary system require explanation. At the national level, the choice of exchange rate regime and the desired level of the exchange rate involve distributionally relevant tradeoffs. Interest group and partisan pressures, the structure of political institutions, and the electoral incentives of politicians therefore influence exchange rate regime and level decisions. At the international level, the character of the international monetary system depends on strategic interaction among governments, driven by their national concerns and constrained by the international environment. A global or regional fixed-rate currency regime, in particular, requires at least coordination and often explicit cooperation among national governments.","political_science"
"China's economic growth and transition pose fascinating questions for social scientists. In the economic realm, proponents of the market-preserving federalism (MPF) model appear to have gone too far. In reality, China's central leadership has retained the prerogative to appoint top provincial officials as well as the power to reconfigure central-provincial fiscal relations, thus defying predictions of the MPF model. In the social realm, rapid growth has propelled the expansion of the middle class, but the large increase in inequality has sharpened social cleavages and class conflicts. The uncertainties of market transition and rising social conflicts pose major challenges for the ruling elite and for China's political development.","political_science"

"Comparative research on political institutions has begun to turn from issues of formal institutional design to issues of institutional strength. Rather than assuming a tight fit between formal rules and political behavior, these studies examine how variation in the stability and/or enforcement of formal rules shapes actors' expectations and behavior. This article explores the emerging research agenda on institutional strength. It disaggregates the concept of institutional strength into two dimensions—enforcement and stability—and it argues that institutions vary widely on both dimensions. The article then examines the sources of this variation and its implications for comparative research. It shows how recent research on weak institutions may be used to refine existing theories of institutional effects, design, and development, which should broaden the comparative scope of these theories. The conclusion examines ways of developing comparative measures of institutional strength.","political_science"
"The issue of climate change poses something of a puzzle. For all the attention accorded the issue, climate change/global warming has spawned surprisingly little grassroots activism in the contemporary United States. Drawing on social movement theory, the author seeks to explain this puzzle. The prevailing consensus among movement scholars is that the prospect for movement emergence is facilitated by the confluence of three factors: the expansion of political opportunities, the availability of mobilizing structures, and cognitive and affective mobilization through framing processes. The author then applies each of these factors to the case of climate change, arguing that (a) awareness of the issue developed during an especially inopportune period in American politics, (b) the organizations that arose to address the issue were ill suited to the kind of grassroots mobilization characteristic of successful movements, and (c) the amorphous nature of the issue played havoc with efforts at strategic framing.","political_science"

In this review, we discuss recent findings explaining variation in the mix of clientelistic strategies across countries, regions, and individuals and identify a few areas for future progress, particularly in explaining variation in targeting of inducements by politicians on different types of voters.","political_science"
"The Eurozone crisis constitutes a grave challenge to European integration. This article presents an overview of the causes of the crisis and analyzes why it has been so difficult to resolve. We focus on how responses to the crisis were shaped by distributive conflicts both among and within countries. On the international level, debtor and creditor countries have fought over the distribution of responsibility for the accumulated debt; countries with current account surpluses and deficits have fought over who should implement the policies necessary to reduce the current account imbalances. Within countries, interest groups have fought to shift the costs of crisis resolution away from themselves. The article emphasizes that the Eurozone crisis shares many features of previous debt and balance-of-payments crises. However, the Eurozone's predicament is unique because it is set within a monetary union that strongly constrains the policy options available to policy makers and vastly increases the interdependence of the euro crisis countries. The outcome of the crisis has also been highly unusual because the costs of crisis resolution have been borne almost exclusively by the debtor countries and taxpayers in the Eurozone.","political_science"
"Considerable attention has been paid over the past decade to political cleavages in post-communist Eastern Europe. Investigators have attempted to establish whether such cleavages exist, to map their character, and to explain their formation theoretically. Research initially focused on whether communist rule had created distinctive forms of cleavage in the region as a whole, or indeed obliterated social capacity to form any structured social or ideological divisions. The results of this work, however, have tended to support a more differentiated and less sui generis understanding in which the character of cleavages varies considerably across the region. Debate has turned to accounting for the formation and variation in cleavages by reference to factors such as long-standing cultural legacies, forms of communist rule and modes of transition from it, the effects of social structure and individual social experience in the post-communist period, and the impact of institutions and party strategies.","political_science"
"Most political scientists and economists unequivocally accept the proposition that abundant mineral resources are more often a curse than a blessing, particularly for developing countries. We argue that the widely accepted contention that an abundance of mineral resources and the influx of external rents generated from these resources during boom periods are to blame for the so-called “resource curse” should be revisited. Instead, we offer a new research agenda for studying the problem of resource-rich states that shifts the locus of study away from the “paradox of plenty” to a more appropriate paradox—that the concentration of wealth impoverishes the state whereas the dispersion of wealth enriches the state. This agenda focuses on three interrelated issues: the structure of ownership over mineral resources, the importance of strong institutions, and the relative influence of domestic versus international factors.","political_science"
"Justifications for war often invoke reputational or social aspirations: the need to protect national honor, status, reputation for resolve, credibility, and respect. Studies of these motives struggle with a variety of challenges: their primary empirical manifestation consists of beliefs, agents have incentives to misrepresent these beliefs, their logic is context specific, and they meld intrinsic and instrumental motives. To help overcome these challenges, this review offers a general conceptual framework that integrates their strategic, cultural, and psychological logics. We summarize important findings and open questions, including (a) whether leaders care about their reputations and status, (b) how to address the tension between instrumental and intrinsic motives, (c) how observers draw inferences, (d) to whom and across what contextual breadth these inferences apply, and (e) how these relate to domestic audience costs. Many important, tractable questions remain for future studies to answer.","political_science"
"Should hate speech be banned? This article contends that the debate on this question must be disaggregated into discrete analytical stages, lest its participants continue to talk past one another. The first concerns the scope of the moral right to freedom of expression, and whether hate speech falls within the right's protective ambit. If it does, hate speech bans are necessarily unjust. If not, we turn to the second stage, which assesses whether speakers have moral duties to refrain from hate speech. The article canvasses several possible duties from which such a duty could be derived, including duties not to threaten, harass, offend, defame, or incite. If there is a duty to refrain from hate speech, it is yet a further question whether the duty should actually be enforced. This third stage depends on pragmatic concerns involving epistemic fallibility, the abuse of state power, and the benefits of counter-speech over coercion.","political_science"
"Agent-based models (ABMs) provide a methodology to explore systems of interacting, adaptive, diverse, spatially situated actors. Outcomes in ABMs can be equilibrium points, equilibrium distributions, cycles, randomness, or complex patterns; these outcomes are not directly determined by assumptions but instead emerge from the interactions of actors in the model. These behaviors may range from rational and payoff-maximizing strategies to rules that mimic heuristics identified by cognitive science. Agent-based techniques can be applied in isolation to create high-fidelity models and to explore new questions using simple constructions. They can also be used as a complement to deductive techniques. Overall, ABMs offer the potential to advance social sciences and to help us better understand our complex world.","political_science"
"In my scholarly work, I have sought to understand institutionalized multilateral cooperation in world politics, and the context of such cooperation: extensive economic interdependence, or globalization. What are the political implications of economic interdependence? Under what conditions are states facing globalization willing to share their authority with multilateral organizations over whose policies they exert only indirect and collective influence? I have developed interpretive frameworks and some theory to address these issues. In other work, I have helped to develop precepts for qualitative research design, and I have explored some normative issues associated with institutional accountability and legitimacy. My work on multilateral institutions, which was done in a period of increasing multilateral cooperation, is challenged by increasing inequality in capitalist democracies, financial crisis, and nationalist forms of populism. I am now seeking to understand the international and comparative politics of climate change, which I regard as an existential crisis.","political_science"
"Although scholars tend to downplay the role of religion in political life, the vast majority of people in the world profess a strong allegiance to some spiritual faith. Secularization theory has long held that religion would become irrelevant, leading many comparative scholars to ignore this potentially significant variable. A recent resurgence in religious fundamentalism and “new religious politics” has led more scholars to consider religious actors as important. However, research in this area befalls many of the same problems inherent in earlier secularization theories. A new body of scholarship, known as the “religious economy” school, seeks to address these problems by developing theories built on solid microlevel foundations of human behavior. This line of research holds great promise for the study of religion in comparative politics.","political_science"
"The study of contagion offers important but underexplored opportunities to rethink and advance our understanding of key concepts in political science. These include notably state capacity; social policy; state–society relations, especially the role of trust; nationalism and social solidarity; exclusionary dynamics, such as xenophobia, prejudice, and discrimination; and within political psychology, the role of emotions, including disgust. This article reviews studies on contagion and health within and adjacent to political science. While taking note of the surge of studies around COVID-19, this article focuses on work on infectious disease before and beyond the pandemic. It analyzes the scholarship as it sheds light on the control of infectious diseases, on the one hand, and on the consequences of that control, on the other, while also pointing to connections and feedback loops, especially as they open avenues for future research.","political_science"
"Trying to address a series of large questions—e.g., when peasants rebel, clandestine forms of resistance, state “imagination,” and the origin of the very first agrarian states—led me to abandon much of the standard political science “tool kit.” This is an account of that intellectual journey.\n               \n                  [James C.

"While generative AI shares some similarities with previous technological breakthroughs, it also raises unique challenges for containing social and economic harms. State approaches to AI governance vary; some lay a foundation for transnational governance whereas others do not. We consider some technical dimensions of AI safety in both open and closed systems, as well as the ideas that are presently percolating to safeguard their future development. Examining initiatives for the global community and for the coalition of open societies, we argue for building a dual-track interactive strategy for containing AI's potentially nightmarish unintended consequences. We conclude that AI safety is AI governance, which means that pluralist efforts to bridge gaps between theory and practice and the STEM–humanities divide are critical for democratic sustainability.","political_science"
"From 1968 to 1997, wealthy, advanced democracies generally did not suffer from high levels of chronic terrorism, with two exceptions: (a) advanced democracies that interfered in other countries' affairs through military intervention or occupations were frequent targets of transnational terrorism, and (b) poor democracies with territorial conflicts often experienced related domestic terrorist attacks. Intermediately wealthy and transitioning democracies with internally inconsistent institutions were more likely to experience domestic terrorism than advanced democracies and authoritarian regimes. There is very little agreement about why these trends persist. I identify the competing explanations that have emerged within the literature as well as remaining controversies. I also present preliminary evidence suggesting that since 9/11, terrorism persists in the usual pattern but may be increasingly prevalent in nondemocratic countries. I offer five speculative explanations for this and four suggestions for how the field should proceed.","political_science"
"Globalization has reduced the importance of distance between countries. Yet, within countries, geography matters now more than ever. Economic activities, including production and employment, occur unevenly across space within countries, and globalization consequently impacts various regions differently. Some areas benefit from international economic integration while others lose, and as a result, economic geography shapes citizens’ experience of globalization. Economic geography also influences governments’ responses to globalization and economic shocks. Economic geography consequently merits the attention of political scientists. By examining economic geography, researchers will find new traction on long-standing theoretical debates and valuable insights on recent developments, including the growing backlash against globalization. The challenges of studying economic geography include causal complexity and measurement issues.","political_science"
"International investment law provides a means for states to mitigate political risks that foreign investors face inside their borders. Its status quo includes thousands of international investment agreements (IIAs) and Investor–State Dispute Settlement (ISDS), a dispute resolution mechanism in which foreign, private investors sue host states in ad hoc international tribunals in pursuit of monetary compensation for property rights violations. In this review, we survey the vast contemporary literature on this regime to evidence the ways in which scholars have challenged the purported original goals of international investment law and its distributional consequences. In light of this literature's accomplishments, we highlight opportunities for a refocusing of international relations scholars’ research agenda on dynamics of continuity and change in the regime. The status quo in international investment law is fragile, and, in our view, the regime is on the brink of a major shift toward prioritizing state sovereignty well above political risk mitigation.","political_science"
"Hierarchy is a nearly ubiquitous form of political organization. This article examines the concept of hierarchy and addresses three questions. What is hierarchy? When is it selected? Why does it matter? I outline and make explicit a theoretical approach common to the disparate literatures on political parties, domestic structures, and international relations. Drawn from the theory of the firm in economics, this relational contracting approach focuses on how hierarchy reduces transaction costs and safeguards specific assets, and it explains the nature and persistence of hierarchy and why it develops in some strategic settings and not others. Relational contracting theory has clear limitations, however, whose gaps are highlighted and sometimes filled by alternative approaches to understanding hierarchy. Integrating relational contracting theory with these alternatives promises a more complete approach.","political_science"
"Do people assimilate new information in an efficient and unbiased manner—that is, do they update prior beliefs in accordance with Bayes' rule? Or are they selective in the way that they gather and absorb new information? Although many classic studies in political science and psychology contend that people resist discordant information, more recent research has tended to call the selective perception hypothesis into question. We synthesize the literatures on biased assimilation and belief polarization using a formal model that encompasses both Bayesian and biased learning. The analysis reveals (a) the conditions under which these phenomena may be consistent with Bayesian learning, (b) the methodological inadequacy of certain research designs that fail to control for preferences or prior information, and (c) the limited support that exists for the more extreme variants of the selective perception hypothesis.","political_science"
"Organized around several major theoretical traditions in international relations, this essay suggests which literature in psychology should be of greatest interest to different kinds of international relations scholars. New work in cognitive social psychology and behavioral decision theory simultaneously expands on and qualifies earlier error-and-bias portraits of the foreign policy maker, thereby enriching our understanding of internal divisions within the realist camp. Work on bounded rationality in competitive markets and mixed-motive games, as well as the literature on the power of human emotions to shape judgments of what represents an equitable allocation of scarce resources or a just resolution of conflicts of interest, can inform neo-institutionalist and constructivist theories. Developments in cross-cultural social psychology shed light on constructivist arguments about the creation and maintenance of international social order that typically rest on assumptions about decision making that are qualitatively different from realist and institutionalist approaches to world politics.","political_science"
"The study of religion holds great promise for the study of identity, institutional origins, the state, and the strategies of institutional actors in comparative politics. Doctrinal differences translate into distinct patterns of state institutions, economic performance, and policy preferences. Religious attachments affect voting and popular mobilization. Churches can become powerful institutional players that lobby, influence policy, and form effective coalitions with both secular and denominational partners. Finally, natural religious monopolies and (conversely) resolutely secular countries show how churches have played a central role in the struggle of nations and states. The relationship is thus mutual: religion influences political attitudes and institutions, and politics affects religious practice and political activity.","political_science"
"This article reviews the changing status of single-country research in comparative politics, a field defined by the concept of comparison. An analysis of single-country research published in top general interest and comparative politics journals reveals that single-country research has evolved from an emphasis on description and theory generation to an emphasis on hypothesis testing and research design. This change is a result of shifting preferences for internal versus external validity combined with the quantitative and causal inference revolutions in the social sciences. A consequence of this shift is a change in substantive focus from macropolitical phenomena to micro-level processes, with consequences for the ability of comparative politics to address many substantive political phenomena that have long been at the center of the field.","political_science"
"External validity captures the extent to which inferences drawn from a given study's sample apply to a broader population or other target populations. Social scientists frequently invoke external validity as an ideal, but they rarely attempt to make rigorous, credible external validity inferences. In recent years, methodologically oriented scholars have advanced a flurry of work on various components of external validity, and this article reviews and systematizes many of those insights. We first clarify the core conceptual dimensions of external validity and introduce a simple formalization that demonstrates why external validity matters so critically. We then organize disparate arguments about how to address external validity by advancing three evaluative criteria: model utility, scope plausibility, and specification credibility. We conclude with a practical aspiration that scholars supplement existing reporting standards to include routine discussion of external validity. It is our hope that these evaluation and reporting standards help rebalance scientific inquiry, such that the current obsession with causal inference is complemented with an equal interest in generalized knowledge.","political_science"
"Is the US Congress dysfunctional? The American public thinks so: In the summer of 2014, just 7% approved strongly of Congress ( Riffkin 2014 ). Still, legislative scholars disagree about the severity of Congress's legislative challenges. Is legislative deadlock a sign that Congress can no longer identify and resolve major public problems? Or are Congress's difficulties temporary and correctable? In this article, I review theoretical and empirical literatures on the dynamics of lawmaking and evaluate alternative methods for testing lawmaking theories. Finally, I draw on recent research to put contemporary stalemate into historical perspective. I argue that even when Congress and the president have reached agreement on the big issues of the day, Congress's problem-solving capacity appears to have fallen to new lows in recent years. Whether and how well our political system can or will self-correct in the coming years remains an open question.","political_science"
"How do we know whether judges of different backgrounds are biased? We review the substantial political science literature on judicial decision making, paying close attention to how judges' demographics and ideology can influence or structure their decision making. As the research demonstrates, characteristics such as race, ethnicity, and gender can sometimes predict judicial decision making in limited kinds of cases; however, the literature also suggests that these characteristics are far less important in shaping or predicting outcomes than is ideology (or partisanship), which in turn correlates closely with gender, race, and ethnicity. This leads us to conclude that assuming judges of different backgrounds are biased because they rule differently is questionable. Given that the application of the law rarely provides one objectively correct answer, it is no surprise that judges' decisions vary according to their personal backgrounds and, more importantly, according to their ideology.","political_science"
"There is little consensus on whether foreign aid can reliably increase economic growth in recipient countries. We review the literature on aid allocation and provide new evidence suggesting that since 1990 aid donors reward political contestation but not political inclusiveness. Then we examine some challenges in analyzing cross-national data on the aid/growth relationship. Finally, we discuss the causal mechanisms through which foreign aid might affect growth and argue that politics can be viewed as both (a) an exogenous constraint that conditions the causal process linking aid to growth and (b) an endogenous factor that is affected by foreign aid and in turn impacts economic growth.","political_science"
"Democracy requires that citizens' opinions play some role in shaping policy outcomes, including in foreign policy. Yet, although the literature on public opinion and foreign policy has made great progress in recent decades, scholars have reached no consensus concerning what the public thinks, or thinks about, with respect to foreign policy; how it comes to hold those opinions; or whether those opinions influence (or even should influence) foreign policy. In this article, we first review the extensive gains in scholarly knowledge in the area of public opinion and foreign policy over the past several decades, emphasizing relatively recent work. We then suggest a framework, based on the concept of market equilibrium, aimed at synthesizing the disparate research programs that constitute the literature on public opinion and foreign policy. To do so, in addition to considering the relationship between leaders and the public, we incorporate a third strategic actor, the mass media, which we believe plays a critical role alongside citizens and elites in shaping the public's attitudes about, and influence on, foreign policy. Our goal is to clarify the multifaceted relationships between these actors and foreign policy outcomes.","political_science"

We conclude with an overview of the future outlook of this political movement.","political_science"

Does efficiency frame how policy problems are bundled in jurisdictions?

The purpose here is to probe fundamental commonalities of government structure which are usually taken for granted because they exist in an otherwise fluctuating political universe.","political_science"
"I review recent efforts by political scientists and economists to explain cross-national variation in corruption using subjective ratings, and examine the robustness of reported findings. Quite strong evidence suggests that highly developed, long-established liberal democracies, with a free and widely read press, a high share of women in government, and a history of openness to trade, are perceived as less corrupt. Countries that depend on fuel exports or have intrusive business regulations and unpredictable inflation are judged more corrupt. Although the causal direction is usually unclear, instrumenting with income as of 1700 suggests higher development does cause lower perceived corruption. However, controlling for income, most factors that predict perceived corruption do not correlate with recently available measures of actual corruption experiences (based on surveys of business people and citizens that ask whether they have been expected to pay bribes recently). Reported corruption experiences correlate with lower development, and possibly with dependence on fuel exports, lower trade openness, and more intrusive regulations. The subjective data may reflect opinion rather than experience, and future research could usefully focus on experience-based indicators.","political_science"
"This article provides an overview of recent developments in historical institutionalism. First, it reviews some distinctions that are commonly drawn between the “historical” and the “rational choice” variants of institutionalism and shows that there are more points of tangency than typically assumed. However, differences remain in how scholars in the two traditions approach empirical problems. The contrast of rational choice's emphasis on institutions as coordination mechanisms that generate or sustain equilibria versus historical institutionalism's emphasis on how institutions emerge from and are embedded in concrete temporal processes serves as the foundation for the second half of the essay, which assesses our progress in understanding institutional formation and change. Drawing on insights from recent historical institutional work on “critical junctures” and on “policy feedbacks,” the article proposes a way of thinking about institutional evolution and path dependency that provides an alternative to equilibrium and other approaches that separate the analysis of institutional stability from that of institutional change.","political_science"
"Democratic theorists have paid increasing attention to problems of political representation over the past two decades. Interest is driven by (a) a political landscape within which electoral representation now competes with new and informal kinds of representation; (b) interest in the fairness of electoral representation, particularly for minorities and women; (c) a renewed focus on political judgment within democratic theory; and (d) a new appreciation that participation and representation are complementary forms of citizenship. We review recent innovations within democratic theory, focusing especially on problems of fairness, constituency definition, deliberative political judgment, and new, nonelectoral forms of representation.","political_science"
"Electoral gender quotas now exist in a majority of national legislatures worldwide. In general, quotas are followed by greater legislative attention to the interests and priorities of women as a group. Across cases, effects have been most pronounced on issues related to women's rights, public health, and poverty alleviation. Quotas can influence policy in two general ways: First, quotas may send cues to all officeholders, prompting broad changes in legislator behavior among both men and women. Second, quotas typically bring more women into legislatures, causing a shift in aggregate legislator preferences and increasing women's ability to collectively influence legislative decisions. Yet, the positive effects of quotas are not universal, and some research reveals instances in which quotas have led to limited policy changes or even to more gender-inegalitarian outcomes. I suggest several variables that may moderate the relationship between quota adoption and policy change, including underexplored dimensions of quota design.","political_science"
"Political scientist Hakeem Jefferson (Stanford University) facilitated a discussion about race, policing, and the state of American democracy with fellow political scientists Cathy J. Cohen (University of Chicago), Yanilda M. González (Harvard Kennedy School), Rebecca U. Thorpe (University of Washington), and Vesla M. Weaver (Johns Hopkins University) on May 26, 2021. The conversation occurred a year after George Perry Floyd Jr., a 46-year-old Black man, was murdered by a White police officer in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Moving beyond common notions of democracy that focus primarily on voting and electoral participation, the panelists discussed how American policing and the criminal justice system, more broadly, redefine citizenship, redistribute power, and shape marginalized people's understanding of their place in society. Closing remarks addressed the potential for change in how criminal justice institutions treat marginalized people and how political scientists can more usefully contribute to efforts that strengthen democracy for all.

"Does ethnic diversity erode social trust? Continued immigration and corresponding growing ethnic diversity have prompted this essential question for modern societies, but few clear answers have been reached in the sprawling literature. This article reviews the literature on the relationship between ethnic diversity and social trust through a narrative review and a meta-analysis of 1,001 estimates from 87 studies. The review clarifies the core concepts, highlights pertinent debates, and tests core claims from the literature on the relationship between ethnic diversity and social trust. Several results stand out from the meta-analysis. We find a statistically significant negative relationship between ethnic diversity and social trust across all studies. The relationship is stronger for trust in neighbors and when ethnic diversity is measured more locally. Covariate conditioning generally changes the relationship only slightly. The review concludes by discussing avenues for future research.","political_science"
"In this article, I review the social science literature on racial fluidity, the idea that race is flexible and impermanent. I trace the ongoing evolution of racial classifications and boundaries in the United States and Latin America, two regions that share a history of European colonization, slavery, and high levels of race mixing but that have espoused very different racial ideologies. Traditionally, for many groups in the United States, race was seen as unchangeable and determined by ancestry; in contrast, parts of Latin America have lacked strict classification rules and embraced race mixing. However, recent research has shown that race in the United States can change across time and context, particularly for populations socially defined as more ambiguous, while some Latin American racial boundaries are becoming more stringent. I argue that the fluidity of race has redefined our understanding of racial identities, and propose several directions for future political science scholarship that bridges disciplines and methodological approaches.","political_science"
"A profusion of recent research has focused on historical legacies as key to understanding contemporary outcomes. We review this body of research, analyzing both the comparative-historical analysis (CHA) and modern political economy (MPE) research traditions as applied to the study of communism, imperialism, and authoritarianism. We restrict our focus to the sizeable subset of arguments that meets a relatively strict definition of legacies, i.e., arguments that locate the roots of present-day outcomes in causal factors operative during an extinct political order. For all their differences, the CHA and MPE approaches both face the challenges of convincingly identifying the sources of historical persistence and of reckoning with alternative channels of causation. We find that mechanisms of persistence in legacy research generally belong to one of three main categories. While both traditions acknowledge the role of institutions in historical persistence, CHA research tends to emphasize the lasting power of coalitions, whereas work in MPE often argues for the persistence of cognitions. We argue that, at their best, CHA and MPE approaches yield complementary insights. Further progress in legacy research will benefit from greater cross-fertilization across research traditions and deeper recognition of commonalities across communist, imperialist, and authoritarian regimes.","political_science"
"How does the experience of economic shocks affect individuals' political views and voting behavior? Inspired partly by the fallout of the financial crisis of 2008, research on this question has proliferated. Findings from studies covering a broadening range of countries and economic contexts highlight several notable patterns. Economic shocks—e.g., job loss or sharp drop in income—exert a significant and theoretically predictable, if often transient, effect on political attitudes. In contrast, the effect on voting behavior is more limited in magnitude and its manifestations less understood. Negative economic shocks tend to increase support for more expansive social policy and for redistribution, strengthening the appeal of the left. But such shocks also tend to decrease trust in political institutions, thus potentially driving the voters to support radical or populist parties, or demobilizing them altogether. Further research is needed to detect the conditions that lead to these distinct voting outcomes.","political_science"
"In Basic Interests: The Importance of Groups in Politics and in Political Science (1998) , Frank Baumgartner and Beth Leech characterized a series of problems in the interest group research published between 1950 and 1995. In this article, we assess whether recent research has become more theoretically coherent, more attentive to context, and broader in both scope and topical focus, all of which are crucial to advancing the systematic study of interest groups and their policy-making activities. Overall, we observe more large-scale and longitudinal studies between 1996 and 2011 than Baumgartner &amp; Leech observed between 1950 and 1995. This newer literature also is much more likely to focus on key issues for students of politics, and to give attention to the context in which organizations operate to affect public policy. However, we see minimal evidence that scholars addressing similar questions within the subfield are operating from one or a few shared theoretical frameworks.","political_science"
"Despite high mass poverty, illiteracy, and religious and linguistic heterogeneity, the states of South Asia enjoy a moderately high level of orderly and democratic government. This contrast to other comparable parts of the world is explained to some extent by the cultural, institutional, and social legacies of British colonial rule and the orderly transfer of power in these successor states. However, 50 years after decolonization, one needs to look beyond colonial rule for explanations. The essay develops a general model based on a rational choice perspective to explain political stability through institutional arrangements. In its application of this model to South Asia, the chapter suggests that political stability is conditional (a) on the capacity of the postcolonial state to innovate new institutions and (b) on the ability of its new political elites to integrate modern and premodern political structures and values within the institutional set-up and to consult the masses periodically through a democratic political process. This model is illustrated with reference to state-society, state-economy, and interstate relations within South Asia.","political_science"
"This paper traces the course of inquiry on the U.S. Congress from 1945 to the present day, noting antecedents in the work of Woodrow Wilson, and through Wilson, of Walter Bagehot. Since 1945, the study of Congress has gone through an anglophile responsible-party phase, championed especially by William Yandell Elliott at Harvard, followed by a sociologically oriented legislative-behavior phase, identified in one generation with Lewis Anthony Dexter, Stephen K. Bailey, David Truman, and especially Ralph K. Huitt at Wisconsin, and in the next generation with Richard Fenno, Charles O. Jones, Donald R. Matthews, and H. Douglas Price, among others. A third, contemporary intellectual orientation is identified most strongly with rational choice scholars, especially from the University of Rochester. The agenda of political science is formed not only by the literature but by events. Hence, the congressional reforms of the 1970s were influential in shaping the literature, as were such organizational innovations as the Congressional Fellowship Program and the Study of Congress, both projects of the American Political Science Association.","political_science"
"This review assesses the state of the newly emerging field of the study of post-communist elections and voting by building and analyzing a database of 101 articles on the topic that have appeared in 16 leading academic journals (8 general political science journals and 8 post-communist area studies journals) between 1990 and 2000. The database is then used to make inferences concerning both what is being studied by scholars and how it is being studied. The review systematically assesses which countries have been analyzed, the types of elections examined, the prevalence of comparative analysis, the division between quantitative and qualitative research, and the types of data used in quantitative studies. It then turns to substantive questions, examining both how scholars have explained post-communist election results and voting decisions, and what they have used these elections to explain.","political_science"
"This review concerns political preferences—what they are and where they come from. We begin by documenting the close relationship between processes of preference formation and change. Rather than suddenly appearing, most preferences emerge from interactions between individuals and their environment. This aspect of preference formation poses a concrete challenge: to uncover the mechanics of these interactions in important social contexts. We then describe political science research that meets this challenge. We find an expansive literature that clarifies how phenomena such as parties, campaigns, and the need to act strategically affect preferences. This work provides many widely applicable insights.","political_science"
"This review examines the policies and practices that address the evolving conditions of risk, security, and disaster management in U.S. society. Although each condition presents particular challenges to public agencies and the communities they serve, all represent varying states of uncertainty and require different approaches for informed action. This analysis reframes the issue of managing risk by focusing on the distinction between policies and practices developed in reference to natural and technological hazards and those developed to enhance security from hostile acts. The author concludes that building networks of organizations committed to a process of continual inquiry, informed action, and adaptive learning is a more flexible, robust strategy than the standard practice of establishing greater control over possible threats through administrative structures. Supported by methods of network analysis, computational simulation, information infrastructure, and long-term policy goals, networked strategies offer an important alternative to hierarchical structures that prove vulnerable in uncertain environments.","political_science"
"This assessment of research on contemporary democratic politics in Latin America is organized around the distinction between institutional and alternative approaches. Initially it considers institutionalism on its own terms and, through an assessment of the debate about the institutional causes of gridlock, draws attention to key strengths of this literature. Thereafter, this article adopts a broader perspective that exposes some limitations but also other strengths of institutional analyses and considers the possibility of combining insights developed from institutional and alternative theoretical perspectives. The suggested terms of integration are as follows. With regard to causal theorizing, institutionalists need to borrow ideas from a broader literature on political regimes, especially regarding the causes of transitions to, and the breakdown of, democracy. With regard to descriptive theorizing, in contrast, students of the quality of democracy need to incorporate the contributions of institutionalists, especially regarding principal-agent relationships among citizens, policy makers, and policy administrators. Throughout this review, various pointed suggestions to advance research are offered.","political_science"
"For more than two decades political scientists have discussed rising elite polarization in the United States, but the study of mass polarization did not receive comparable attention until fairly recently. This article surveys the literature on mass polarization. It begins with a discussion of the concept of polarization, then moves to a critical consideration of different kinds of evidence that have been used to study polarization, concluding that much of the evidence presents problems of inference that render conclusions problematic. The most direct evidence—citizens' positions on public policy issues—shows little or no indication of increased mass polarization over the past two to three decades. Party sorting—an increased correlation between policy views and partisan identification—clearly has occurred, although the extent has sometimes been exaggerated. Geographic polarization—the hypothesized tendency of like-minded people to cluster together—remains an open question. To date, there is no conclusive evidence that elite polarization has stimulated voters to polarize, on the one hand, or withdraw from politics, on the other.","political_science"
"This chapter reviews the literature on causes of arms races, their consequences, and when a state should build up arms and engage in an arms race if necessary. The literature tends to equate external causes with threats; the chapter argues for a broader understanding that includes all causes of rational arming behavior. Internal causes of arms races are then understood to be factors within the state that lead it to adopt suboptimal policies. Although the causes and consequences of arms races are usually dealt with separately, in fact they are closely connected. When a state engages in an arms race because this is its best option, the state is acting rationally, the causes of the arms race are external, and the arms race has no consequences of its own. In contrast, when a state arms because domestic interests have distorted its policy, the arms race produces negative consequences. Research on the consequences of arms races has been hindered by the lack of a fully developed theory of when a state shouldrace; progress on defensive realism is helping to fill this gap.","political_science"
"Since 2001, hundreds of academic studies have examined the “political resource curse,” meaning the claim that natural resource wealth tends to adversely affect a country's governance. There is now robust evidence that one type of mineral wealth, petroleum, has at least three harmful effects: It tends to make authoritarian regimes more durable, to increase certain types of corruption, and to help trigger violent conflict in low- and middle-income countries. Scholars have also made progress toward understanding the mechanisms that lead to these outcomes and the conditions that make them more likely. This essay reviews the evidence behind these claims, the debates over their validity, and some of the unresolved puzzles for future research.","political_science"
"Measuring the preferences of political elites is critically important for analyzing the determinants and consequences of elite behavior. The decisions that elites make when casting roll call votes seem to provide an ideal opportunity for measuring elite preferences and testing theories of the political process. The fact that the resulting ideal points are a consequence of applying a statistical model to a model of individual choice, however, may affect their usefulness for measuring elite preferences and testing predictions regarding individual and collective decision making. When analyzing roll call votes, scholars should be mindful of how their decisions may affect the estimates from their analyses. I use simulations to illustrate how the nonrandom selection of roll calls may affect the ability to estimate ideal points that accurately reflect the preferences responsible for generating the observed votes, and I discuss work integrating the many models involved in the production and consumption of roll call estimates.","political_science"
"The past century of research has identified a host of economic, political, demographic, and other factors that seem to be associated with the prevalence of riots. The study of riots has, however, probably focused too much on these “push” factors that lead to violence and not enough on understanding the response of the state to riots. Understanding the political incentives that motivate democratic and authoritarian states to sometimes allow riots to take place and at other times to take the strongest possible law-and-order measures to prevent them is key to understanding variation in violence. Scholars also need to pay more attention to the psychological factors that encourage people to riot, and to the micro-logic of target choice within these larger events.","political_science"
"Wrestling with basic problems of causal inference between institutions and outcomes has been a central focus of political science over the last decade, and as elsewhere in the discipline, scholars of postcommunism have begun to make some headway on these problems. Their efforts have not only advanced important debates about postcommunism, but also in many cases addressed long-standing concerns in political science. This is in itself a sign that after years on the periphery of political science prior to 1989, the study of politics and economics in postcommunist Eurasia has come in from the cold.","political_science"
"Modernization theory is a cornerstone of much of political science, despite the mounting evidence against its predictions. We outline a theory in which the distribution of political power critically combines with political culture. We call the basic components of culture “attributes” and argue that these can be combined into larger cultural configurations. These configurations interact with the distribution of power and lead to three distinct self-reinforcing paths of political development, with very different state–society relations, institutions, and economic structures. These are paths to Despotic, Absent, and Shackled Leviathans. The role of cultural configurations is critical in legitimizing the social arrangements in each path. None of the three different paths we highlight support modernization theory. We discuss how political equilibria can change in ways critically dependent on cultural and political entrepreneurship in order to formulate and popularize new cultural configurations and institutionalize political changes.","political_science"
"Political geography is one of the most exciting subdisciplines to emerge from the “spatial turn” in the social sciences. Arising largely within the discipline of geography, political geography has deep implications for political science, and yet these implications have not yet been widely recognized among political scientists. Conversely, political geographers have not yet profited enough from the rich field of political science. Political geography has the potential to dramatically transform many areas of established political science research. We focus on two: (a) the study of “contextual effects” on political behavior and (b) the study of governance by applying the “new institutionalism.” By spatializing the basic premises of these political science subfields, researchers can find new ways of looking at old questions. We conclude that political scientists should move beyond territorial questions of geography and begin thinking about the intrinsic spatiality of all political action, events, and institutions.","political_science"
"Although millions of Americans take psychoactive medicines (e.g. Prozac and Ritalin), few social scientists believe biological theories and findings should be integrated with research on human behavior. Four topics illustrate current studies linking politics and the life sciences: (a) Developments in genetics and medicine indicate that governmental policies have greatly underrated the dangers posed by radiation and the social transformations that will result from DNA sequencing. (b) Research on brain structures and neurochemistry shows how toxic chemicals undermine normal emotions and behavior. Heavy metal burdens are higher in violent criminals, and exposure to these toxins is significantly correlated with rates of violence (controlling for socioeconomic, ethnic, and demographic factors). (c) An untested chemical used to treat water supplied to 140 million Americans significantly increases both odds of dangerous lead uptake and behavioral dysfunctions in children and adults. (d) The complexity of gene-environment interactions challenges accepted theories of gender, sociopolitical inequalities, ethnocentrism, and history. Such research in biopolitics can illuminate policy controversies in education, substance abuse, and crime.","political_science"
"There is an unexamined paradox in the history of government in the West. The so-called absolutist monarchs of Europe overwhelmingly chartered republican corporations—e.g., towns, universities, and guilds whose members elected their leaders. Indeed, modern constitutional democracy is patterned after them. Yet, modern democracies themselves have overwhelmingly chartered authoritarian corporations—e.g., universities and business corporations whose subjects have no vote. After this Great Inversion, corporations, which once distributed power and wealth, now concentrate them, straining constitutional democracy. Against this backdrop, this article analyzes the major types of relation maintained between states and corporations: constitutive (states charter corporations), mimetic (states and corporations recurrently copy one another's organizational features), and instrumental (each leans on the other, and sometimes captures it, to better advance its own purposes). The article then examines the special challenges that corporate economies pose to constitutional democracy and considers whether a partial reversal of the Great Inversion could reduce them.","political_science"
"Among advanced democracies, the United States has traditionally been unique owing to the absence of ideological mass political parties. American parties’ scholars have nevertheless traditionally viewed stronger and more ideologically distinct national parties as essential to improve the quality of the American democratic process, a view reflected in the 1950 APSA report, Toward a More Responsible Party System. In the following decades the American parties appeared to weaken still further in all aspects, but this apparent party decline in fact signified a transition to a contemporary American party system with more polarized parties similar to those envisaged by the 1950 report. It remains doubtful, however, that American democracy has been enhanced by these developments. Ironically, the advent of more ideologically coherent parties has also made party scholars more aware of the potentially unhealthy side effects that may attend such a development in a separated governing system.","political_science"
"Although Herbert Simon's work is often cited by political scientists, it has not generated a large research program in the discipline. This is a waste of a major intellectual resource. The main challenge to the rational choice research program—now the most important research program in political science—can be developed by building on Simon's ideas on bounded rationality. The essay defends this assertion by examining how the work of both the early Simon (primarily satisficing-and-search models) and the later Simon (on problem solving) can shed light on important topics in our discipline such as budgeting, turnout, and party competition.","political_science"
"Normative theorists of corruption have developed an institutional conception that is distinct from both the individualist approaches focused on quid pro quo exchanges and other institutional approaches found in the literature on developing societies. These theorists emphasize the close connection between patterns of corruption and the legitimate functions of institutions. The corruption benefits the institution while undermining it. Reforms therefore should be directed toward finding alternatives for the functions the corruption serves. Also, institutional corruption does not require that its perpetrators have corrupt motives, and it is not limited to political institutions. This review examines four leading theories and discusses criticisms of their approach. A tripartite framework for analyzing the elements of institutional corruption is proposed. Although the theories are useful for distinguishing institutional corruption from the more familiar forms of individual corruption, they could be enriched by giving greater attention to the work on individual corruption in its structural forms in developing societies.","political_science"
"This review examines state building in the Middle East from a long-term, historical perspective. The Middle East's early transition to settled agriculture meant the region was home to many of the most sophisticated and best-developed states in the ancient world. As Middle Eastern states emerged from Late Antiquity, their fiscal and bureaucratic capacity enabled institutional forms not possible in Europe, including reliance on slave soldiers for the state military elite as well as state control of land that could be distributed to state servants in the form of temporary, revocable land grants. Because a landed gentry did not emerge as an influence-wielding social class in the Middle East until a relatively late date, religious elites—who served as important providers of public goods as a result of their control of Islamic charitable foundations—became key intermediaries between state and society. Core features of the institutions of Islam's classical period largely persisted until the decline of the Ottoman Empire with implications for the nation-state forms to follow.","political_science"

"This essay examines the failure to anticipate the terrorist attacks of September 11 from four perspectives: cognitive biases of government analysts and policy makers concerned with terrorism, organizational pathologies of key bureaucracies such as the CIA and the FBI, political and strategic errors of senior government officials, and the unusual nature of al Qaeda. Drawing on past studies of strategic surprise, it argues that agencies such as the CIA at times did impressive work against the terrorist organization, but that in general the U.S. government, and the U.S. intelligence community in particular, lacked a coherent approach for triumphing over the skilled terrorists it faced. In hindsight, it is clear that numerous mistakes at all levels of the U.S. government and the broader U.S. analytic community made strategic surprise more likely.","political_science"
"In the United States, televised political advertising is the main way that modern campaigns communicate with voters. Although political scientists have made great progress in the study of its effects in recent decades, much of that progress has come in the area of advertising's indirect effects: its impact on learning and the effect of its tone on voter turnout. This essay reviews what scholars know about how political advertising affects voter decisions, voter knowledge, and election outcomes. We argue that scholars still have a long road to travel before being able to speak definitively about whether and to what extent political advertisements are successful in achieving the goal of their sponsors: winning elections. This state of affairs may be due to the vast number of methods used to measure the key independent variable in these studies: advertising exposure. Accordingly, in the last section of the essay, we review and critique seven approaches to the study of political advertising.","political_science"
"This review examines humanitarian governance, defined as the increasingly organized and internationalized attempt to save the lives, enhance the welfare, and reduce the suffering of the world's most vulnerable populations. Political scientists and international relations scholars are only now beginning to explain this rapidly growing global governance of humanity, which is particularly evident in the developing literatures on humanitarian intervention, emergency relief, peacebuilding, and refugee protection. As they increasingly engage this relatively unexplored area of global life, political scientists are using the familiar analytics of the global governance literature to explain the origins, design, and effectiveness of this collective activity. This essay, though, interjects an alternative perspective, one that draws from critical theory, to widen the research agenda of the study of humanitarian governance. Specifically, the essay raises six central questions: What kind of world is being imagined and produced? What accounts for the tremendous growth of humanitarian governance over the last century? Who governs? How is humanitarian governance organized and accomplished? What are the principal techniques of control? By what authority do humanitarians govern and what do they do with that authority?","political_science"
"Despite their centrality to modern democracy, until recently political parties were relegated to the margins of normative democratic theory, taking a back seat to social movements, civil society associations, deliberative experiments, spaces for local participatory government, and direct popular participation. Yet, in the past 15 years, a burgeoning literature has emerged in democratic theory focused directly on parties and partisanship; that is our focus in this review. We locate three main normative defenses of parties: one centered in the special role parties can play in political justification as agents of public reason, a second that looks to the way parties contribute to deliberation, and a third that focuses on the partisan commitment to regulated political rivalry and peaceful rotation in office. In this last connection, we survey work on the constitutional status of parties and reasons for banning parties. We then consider the relation of partisanship to citizenship, and in a fourth section we turn to the ethics of partisanship. Parties and partisanship are interwoven but separable: If partisans are necessary to realize the value of parties, the reverse holds as well, and parties are necessary to realize the value of partisanship.","political_science"
"This article explores how realism in political theory can inform our understanding of political corruption. Whereas political moralists see corruption as a problem of implementation, which does not undermine their values, realists see corruption as posing a more fundamental problem, challenging the very nature of politics and undermining the attempt to establish and exercise authority in the ordering of conflict and the allocation of resources. Recent realist work has sought to characterize a discrete type of “institutional” corruption, and to construct political corruption as the antithesis of good governance or impartiality. Other work has focused on the micro level, drawing on new insights from psychology and experimental economics to analyze individual decisions and motivations to behave corruptly. This article challenges scholars to build future research upon a richer understanding of the realities of political life that are intrinsic to both individual and institutional patterns of corruption.","political_science"
"This essay reviews recent literature on varieties of capitalism, drawing on insights from existing studies to propose a new, more differentiated way of thinking about contemporary changes in the political economies of the rich democracies. The framework offered here breaks with the “continuum models” on which much of the traditional literature has been based, in which countries are arrayed along a single dimension according to their degree of “corporatism” or, more recently, of “coordination.” In so doing, it reveals combinations—continued high levels of equality with significant liberalization, and declining solidarity in the context of continued significant coordination—that existing theories rule out by definition. I argue that these puzzling combinations cannot be understood with reference to the usual dichotomous, structural variables on which the literature has long relied, but require instead greater attention to the coalitional foundations on which political-economic institutions rest. A coalitional approach reveals that institutions that in the past supported the more egalitarian varieties of capitalism survive best not when they stably reproduce the politics and patterns of the Golden Era but rather when they are reconfigured—in both form and function—on the basis of significantly new political support coalitions.","political_science"
"The reissue of Carl Schmitt's most important works, Political Theology and The Concept of the Political, offers the opportunity for reflection on Schmitt's pervasive influence over myriad fields of political and legal studies and for re-evaluation of the basic tenets of his thought. In these works, the conservative Weimar jurist unveiled his theory of ”the exception,“ put forth his ”friend/enemy“ thesis of politics, and insisted that Enlightenment rationality had undermined the European state, leaving it vulnerable to the forces of atheism, anarchism, and socialism that were taking root in Soviet Russia. Among other issues, this article explores Schmitt's Janus-faced critique of liberalism: For Schmitt, liberals are either not worthy to be considered enemies because they deny the inevitability of mortal combat, or they are, in fact, consummate enemies because they successfully punish and destroy adversaries under the cover of universal, humanitarian principles. The article also interrogates the status of morality in Schmitt's conception of the political—specifically, whether the categories of good and evil inform the distinction between friend and enemy, or whether the political operates in a sphere completely autonomous of morality and theology.","political_science"
"Harold D. Lasswell's extensive and wide-ranging books and essays are extraordinarily rich sources of ideas, methods, and topics for the study of political behavior. Whether and how the legacy of his writings is used by contemporary political scientists and theorists is reported here by way of an investigation of references to his work appearing in mainstream political science journals (available through JSTOR) for the 17 years following the end of his academic career. We find that most references to Lasswell are superficial (perfunctory, suggestive, deferential), although a few are more substantial (critical, extending). We conclude that Lasswell's legacy is today undervalued and underused, to the discipline's detriment.","political_science"
"Big data and data science are transforming the world in ways that spawn new concerns for social scientists, such as the impacts of the internet on citizens and the media, the repercussions of smart cities, the possibilities of cyber-warfare and cyber-terrorism, the implications of precision medicine, and the consequences of artificial intelligence and automation. Along with these changes in society, powerful new data science methods support research using administrative, internet, textual, and sensor-audio-video data. Burgeoning data and innovative methods facilitate answering previously hard-to-tackle questions about society by offering new ways to form concepts from data, to do descriptive inference, to make causal inferences, and to generate predictions. They also pose challenges as social scientists must grasp the meaning of concepts and predictions generated by convoluted algorithms, weigh the relative value of prediction versus causal inference, and cope with ethical challenges as their methods, such as algorithms for mobilizing voters or determining bail, are adopted by policy makers.","political_science"
"This article reviews the literature on the onset and dynamics of domestic terrorism, with special emphasis on the interactions between terrorist organizations, the state, and society. Because this literature has often been based on case studies, we seek to impose some structure to its findings. We challenge the distinction between domestic and international terrorism, which truncates the sample of violence, and we show that the actor-sense of terrorism (violence carried out by underground organizations) is the most appropriate model for causal analysis. Terrorist organizations tend to emerge in developed countries in which the state is able to prevent the loss of control over any part of its territory. Terrorists take advantage of the state's mistakes (when, for example, it is over-repressive or makes ineffective concessions) in order to boost their support. Terrorists cannot survive without some degree of support. Consequently, levels of violence and targets are determined by social constraints.","political_science"

"Recent years have seen a renewed interest in southern distinctiveness within the United States and its ramifications for the nation. This review provides an analysis of recent works and the interpretive issues they raise. I argue that collectively they have broken with the long-established image of the South in political science, the study of which was long organized around the region's anticipated convergence to the patterns of the post–New Deal North. Recent texts have instead emphasized an enduring commitment to white supremacy and a determining influence for the region in shaping national politics and institutions. I identify two broad pathways of southern influence and discuss the debates over its sources. I then discuss recent works on southern regimes and the debates these have provoked. I conclude by suggesting that overcoming the limits of recent works will ultimately undermine some of our more sweeping interpretive claims and foundational premises.","political_science"
"Starting in the 1990s, scholarship has produced interesting, new, nuanced ideas about the potential role of international institutions in transforming the global political system. Political scientists have achieved a new understanding of how the Westphalian system came into being, and this understanding has provided a rudimentary model of the dynamics of system transformation. The new institutionalism has provided insights into the possible role of institutions. Scholars have developed new understandings of secondary consequences of conducting interactions among nation-states through international institutions. The study of a particular institution, the European Union, has been revitalized and important knowledge has emerged about its dynamics and trajectory. Finally, scholars have begun to raise questions about the properties of a non-Westphalian system, especially about how democratic accountability could be established. This chapter examines each of these developments in turn.","political_science"
"Louis Hartz's “liberal tradition” thesis, which argued that the United States was born and has remained essentially “liberal,” has been the subject of vigorous and sustained criticism in recent years. Prominent among that criticism has been the charge that the thesis cannot explain “the politics of exclusion”: the process whereby members of particular social groups (especially racial groups) have been denied equal access to the rights enjoyed by other Americans. As such, many scholars have sought to replace the thesis with alternative accounts of the political identity of the United States. This review critically analyzes these new accounts. Three in particular stand out from the field: the “multiple traditions” thesis, the “liberalism as exclusion” thesis, and the “liberal multiplicity” thesis. I describe and criticize each in turn before concluding that the thesis closest to the original Hartzian view offers the most to future students of American politics.","political_science"
"This article reviews and analyzes recent research on regional integration. The review is structured along a political economy framework and proceeds in three steps. After analyzing the development of regional integration agreements (RIAs) from a historical perspective, I first discuss regional integration as a consequence of the decision-making calculus of office-motivated political leaders who find themselves under pressure from different societal groups interested in promoting or hindering regional integration. These pressures are conveyed, constrained, and calibrated by domestic institutions, which provide an important context for policy making, and in particular for the choice to enter RIAs. The analysis also highlights the importance of international pressures for regional integration. Second, I summarize the determinants and consequences of variations in regional institutional design. Third, I analyze the normative and strategic consequences of regional integration. The article concludes by outlining opportunities for future research, with emphasis on the domestic politics of regional integration, the causes and consequences of institutional design beyond trade agreements, and the consequences of the increasing number of often overlapping regional agreements.","political_science"
"The United States pays a high price for its health system, and governments pay about half the costs. At the same time, the United States distinguishes itself by failing to provide health insurance for 15% of its population. In this article, I review research on the politics and economics of health to investigate three questions. Does this spending represent good value? Why does the United States spend so much on health? Finally, what technical and political challenges do policy makers face as they turn away from government solutions and toward market-based solutions to the challenge of balancing costs, access, and quality?","political_science"
"Replication of simple and transparent experiments should promote the cumulation of knowledge.

"This article analyzes the scholarship on variation among democracies and offers a proposal intended to address the relative lack of consensus over the fundamental conceptual infrastructure underpinning this literature. The framework introduced here differentiates between four dimensions of democracy: authenticity, quality, depth and consolidation—arguing that they may vary with some independence from one another. This approach simultaneously addresses concerns of normative and empirical democratic theory, rooting the conceptualization of democracy's dimensions in central aspirations that motivate normative theorists and political actors. The distinction between authenticity and quality as formulated here centers on the difference between standards understood to be required for membership in the democratic genus and normatively valued goals that surpass such standards. Work on democratic depth, as formulated here, addresses concerns over the possible tension between “minimalist” operational definitions and the underlying idea of democracy with its emphasis on political equality and rule by the people.","political_science"
"This article reviews the literature on the persistence of racial cues and appeals in American elections. I focus on three central themes: racial priming, the influence of the Obama presidential campaigns on racial cues, and racial appeals in the context of a diversifying United States. I identify linkages across these domains while also suggesting avenues for future research. I argue that in the context of a diversifying United States, scholars should develop more measures that capture attitudes that are specific to groups other than African Americans. The nation's growing racial and ethnic diversity is also an opportunity to develop and test more theories that explain the political behavior of racial and ethnic minorities beyond the traditional black–white divide. Finally, since much of the research on racial cues focuses on whites’ racial animus, I suggest that scholars spend more time exploring how racial cues influence the behavior of whites with positive racial attitudes.","political_science"
"The study of race and U.S. politics has always been controversial in the discipline. Theory and evidence are often ignored or misconstrued. Furthermore, literatures that examine the impact of race have developed in relative isolation from one another. We try to address this shortcoming here. We examine research on the influence of race on the political attitudes, behavior, and institutions of both blacks and whites. Our focus is on partisanship, voting, policy opinions, and representation. We identify linkages across these domains and then discuss the implications of this work for assessing the nation's progress toward achieving racial justice.","political_science"
"Individual companies are neglected in American politics scholarship, despite their empirical and normative significance. Interest group theory does not provide an adequate framework for understanding them. Neoclassical microeconomic theory has begun to be developed for political analysis, but its assumptions restrict the scope of its utility. Cyert &amp; March's (1992) “behavioral theory of the firm” provides a more promising foundation, one that dovetails with the historical and institutional tradition in political science. Research in this tradition has begun to analyze how the personal preferences of senior managers, institutional structures, cultural norms, and learning over time affect the political positions and strategies of firms.","political_science"
"How do terrorists and terrorist groups make decisions? And what influence do terrorist decision-making styles have on the course of a terrorist campaign? Efforts to answer these questions have centered on three sets of theories. In order of generality, these are (a) strategic theories, in which the decision to employ terrorism and related forms of political violence is considered to be an instrumental choice; (b) organizational theories, in which the sources of violence are found in the internal dynamics of the terrorist group itself; and (c) psychological theories, in which the decision to employ terrorism is explained within the framework of individual psychology. Most observers agree that these lines of inquiry are not mutually exclusive, but each offers a distinctive approach to terrorist decision making. This essay examines each of these theoretical approaches in turn. It concludes with a brief discussion of the decision-making constraints that help shape terrorist life cycles.","political_science"
"This article reviews efforts to study the impact of money in politics in democracies outside of the United States. In recent years, democracies around the world have begun to publish increasing amounts of data on candidate and party finance. Although much of this information is partial, and some of it is even deliberately misleading, it has nevertheless opened up many new opportunities for researchers to systematically examine the role of money in politics. The development of theories about the origins and impact of political finance regimes and regulations has not kept pace with the newly emerging data. As a result, the field offers increasing scope for researchers to make policy-relevant contributions. Much of the recent research in this area asks how much, and in what ways, the amounts and sources of funding matter. Do either or both of these influence elections or other political outcomes? This article begins by reviewing attempts to answer these questions, then considers some of the promising new areas of investigation in this field.","political_science"
"The growing literature on deliberative democratic practice finds that deliberation is a difficult and relatively rare form of communication. Each moment of a deliberative encounter raises significant obstacles in the path to stimulating greater intentional reflection on public issues. I explore these obstacles in the context of other empirical work in political and social psychology, small group communication, and public opinion. Taken together, these literatures explain why deliberation is difficult to achieve and sustain over time. They also suggest several rules that might assist practitioners in making deliberative democracy work better. Many of the obstacles to deliberative democracy raise questions about key theoretical constructs closely associated with deliberative democratic theory, including equality, legitimacy, autonomy, and reason. I conclude by suggesting that deliberative practitioners, empirical scholars, and theorists might gain from greater interaction.","political_science"
"Deliberative democratic theory has moved beyond the “theoretical statement” stage and into the “working theory” stage. Although this essay revisits some of the main theoretical debates, this is done via a survey and evaluation of the state of deliberative democratic theory as it is being applied in a number of research areas and as it intersects with related normative debates. Five research areas are covered: public law, international relations, policy studies, empirical research, and identity politics.","political_science"
"Economic conditions shape election outcomes in the world's democracies. Good times keep parties in office, bad times cast them out. This proposition is robust, as the voluminous body of research reviewed here demonstrates. The strong findings at the macro level are founded on the economic voter, who holds the government responsible for economic performance, rewarding or punishing it at the ballot box. Although voters do not look exclusively at economic issues, they generally weigh those more heavily than any others, regardless of the democracy they vote in.","political_science"
"In development policy, international organizations have shifted their focus to the importance of good governance and sound institutions. The theory behind this is that only with a high quality of government (QoG) can a country reap the benefits of economic growth and social development. We review the research behind this policy shift and offer a first benchmark statistical analysis. The first section contains a review of the conceptual discussion of what QoG means. Second, we present four salient approaches pertaining to the outcomes of QoG: the debates concerning QoG and democracy, economic growth, corruption, and the rule of law. The third section uses insights gained from these debates to focus on the policy outcomes of QoG—its effects on social well-being, public health, and environmental sustainability. We conclude by discussing possible pitfalls in future research on QoG and development.","political_science"
"For several decades, political scientists who work on the Middle East have been asked by both disciplinary and policy audiences about the region's prospects for democratization. We encounter difficulties in answering that question because it arises from American disciplinary and policy preoccupations, not from regional political dynamics. As a result of those preoccupations, Middle East political scientists have neglected some of the major political forces in the region, while contributing to the development of general comparative theories of democracy and democratization only at the margins.","political_science"
"The subfield of civil–military relations has experienced a remarkable revitalization in recent years, yielding a wealth of intriguing insights. Yet, despite these auspicious developments, research remains unnecessarily divided across multiple dimensions: along the subdisciplinary boundaries of comparative, international, and American politics; within these subdisciplines by independent and dependent variables; by regional focus; by regime type analyzed (democratic, democratizing versus authoritarian); and by scholars' emphasis on normative versus positive analysis. This article aims to bridge existing divides and reduce fragmentation. It proposes several pathways forward, including proposing innovations in deductive theorizing, developing new analytical frameworks, and synthesizing and adjudicating empirical findings. It also suggests ways of bridging to research beyond the study of civil–military relations, such as that on the global phenomenon of democratic backsliding, the efficacy of nonviolent strategies of political struggle, military effectiveness, and the causes and outcomes of interstate war.","political_science"
"We review the use of macroeconomics in political science over the past 40 years. The field has been dominated by new classical theory, which leaves little room for economic policy and focuses attention on what democratic governments can do wrong in the short term. The resulting literatures on political business cycles and central bank independence are large and sophisticated, but they fail, we argue, to account for most of the observed variance in economic policies and outcomes. In the past decade, mainstream macroeconomics has moved away from new classical approaches toward New Keynesian theories with greater scope for macroeconomic policy. These new approaches, with little impact so far in political science, are reviewed and their implications drawn out. Instead of explaining short-sighted government behavior in an economy with little scope for economic policy, the key question for political science may be why governments often pursue longer-run objectives in an economy with considerable scope for economic policy.","political_science"

"Drawing on recent work and data on social protection in the developing world, this essay evaluates the current state of the art and suggests several important new lines of research. We first examine the historical origin and evolution of social protection systems in developing countries, arguing that insufficient attention has been paid to the authoritarian roots of developing nations' social policy. As a preliminary effort to remedy this shortcoming in the literature, we offer a political logic for the observed variation in the character of institutions of social policy established by nondemocratic regimes. Next, we explore recent research examining linkages between models of economic development and welfare regimes in developing countries. Finally, we turn to the study of the political determinants of the social policy reforms that occurred in the final decades of the twentieth century, arguing that variation in reform across policy areas has been more complex than is generally appreciated in the literature. To explain this variation, we develop a theory that identifies the political coalitions supporting different policy outcomes.","political_science"
"This essay focuses on questions that pertain to the ideological, normative, symbolic, and epochal aspects of political Islam. Political theorists, historians, sociologists, and anthropologists have disagreed on whether political Islam is an exclusively modern political phenomenon or is indebted to long-standing Islamic religious commitments. More specifically, they have also disagreed on whether the shape and ambitions of political Islam are entirely determined by the powers and institutions of the modern, bureaucratic state, particularly its secular desire to control, regulate, and reshape religion. These interpretive debates have often sat uneasily with ongoing normative debates about what kind of secularism democracy requires and whether democracy has priority over liberal rights and freedoms.","political_science"
"Research on nuclear security has gone quantitative. Rapid growth in empirical approaches to the consequences of nuclear weapons in recent years promises to settle some controversies, even as it initiates or resurrects debates that may eventually be resolved with better estimates or data. The toolkit for studying nuclear security had long been bereft of quantitative approaches, undermining the virtuous cycle between theory and evidence. New data and growing confidence in statistical approaches have finally produced a systematic empirical literature on the consequences of nuclear weapons. We review existing studies, organizing the literature along thematic lines. We also discuss challenges facing the emergent quantitative literature and suggest several avenues for future research. Although the terminus of the basic research agenda has been anticipated more than once, the literature on nuclear consequences has shown a remarkable ability to generate novel and often unexpected research questions.","political_science"
"Among political scientists, not only is it uncontroversial to say that judges seek to etch their political values into law; it would be near heresy to suggest otherwise. And yet this article does just that because research conducted by scholars (mostly outside of political science) has demonstrated that the policy goal is not the only motivation; it may not even be dominant for many judges. The evidence is now so strong that it poses a serious challenge to the extremely (un)realist(ic) conception of judicial behavior that has dominated the study of law and legal institutions for generations. In addition to reviewing this evidence, we offer a more realistic conception of judicial motivations and suggest how different approaches to the study of courts can contribute to this new avenue of research.","political_science"
"The aging of the global population, combined with changes in technology and cultural understandings of disease and the body, have thrust discussion and contestation over health into the center of local, national, and global politics. Is the politics of health different from the politics of other policy domains? On a number of dimensions, I conclude that it is. Voters and politicians in the developed world appear more likely to accept redistributive claims with respect to health than they are in other policy areas. Nations vary less widely in spending on health than on other functions of government and policy. Moral claims made about health are more likely to attach to its politics than are moral claims about the environment, labor, finance, and energy. More than these other realms, health politics encompasses issues regarding identity, the human body, and other personal matters that endow the health arena with greater significance. Bureaucratic agencies of state are more involved in the provision and regulation of health politics than in other areas, and the science-related nature of state expertise allows medical science itself to be sculpted in deeply political and administrative ways. The article concludes with reasons why political scientists should approach cross-policy generalizations cautiously, and with a call for greater engagement with health politics—to do for political science what health economics, the history of medicine, and medical sociology have done for other social science disciplines.","political_science"
"Political science has given policy makers many useful methods and models for understanding continuities in the world. The utility of many models that were specified with statistical analysis is likely to be undermined as relations among variables change. Today, globalization, the rapid diffusion of technology, the internet, nongovernment organizations, environmental stresses, and population growth and migration present policy makers with unfamiliar challenges. To keep from being surprised, policy makers need methods that indicate possible outcomes but do not specify probabilities, which can be misleading. Instead, policy makers should have analytic methods that warn of discontinuities and illuminate the forces and processes shaping events. Methods based on or compatible with complexity theory seem promising. I describe two methods that can meet the needs of policy makers: Bueno de Mesquita's political expected utility models and multiple scenario analysis. But methods or theories alone will not keep policy makers from being surprised by future developments. It will also be crucial to ask the right questions.","political_science"
"The philosophical literature on global distributive justice has become both more substantive and more rigorous in recent years.

"What do we know about women's negotiation of power in the Global South? The prevailing view tells us that women's power in the Global North is greater than in the South. Yet across analytic levels, the developing world provides striking models of the assertion of women's power that challenge established concepts of political and economic development. At the macro level of state development, research identifies how the subordination of women has been central to the creation and modern infrastructure of liberal democratic states or political orders. Data analysis here provides complementary evidence that the most effective alternatives to patriarchal political orders are originating in the developing world. At the meso level of policy-making processes, developing-world states are more likely than developed-world states to recognize and co-opt women's power. Finally, at the micro level, intrafamily negotiations of patriarchal power are most dynamic in the developing world, with the greatest promise to improve our understanding of the broader systems of power that drive states, policies, and welfare.","political_science"
"American political development (APD) endeavors to understand the dynamism and durability of institutions. This focus has much in common with kindred scholarship in political science on the temporal construction of politics, yet the points of connection between APD and other fields are not always clear. As a remedy, this article reviews the various modes of institutional change found in the literature, the causal mechanisms in each, and the metaphors scholars sometimes use to capture processes that are difficult to observe directly. Using these various modes, mechanisms, and metaphors, scholars of APD explore institutional dynamics at different levels of analysis, highlighting the connections between the micropolitics of situated action and broader transformations at the macro level of the polity. The review concludes by showing how the study of APD speaks to issues of power and political economy that are once again central to political science scholarship.","political_science"
"The study of agenda setting has become curiously disconnected from democratic theory and democratization. Following Schattschneider, Dahl, and recent developments in political theory, I call for its reintegration in theoretical and empirical realms. The concept of agenda democracy allows for better understanding of contests over institutions, significant historical-institutional transformations, the study of inequality and its mechanisms of generation and maintenance, and the building and undermining of democracy. Agenda democracy requires a broad understanding of agendas (beyond a mere menu of final policy choices), recognizes that many democratic regimes have institutions that systematically render agendas nondemocratic, and compels us to look at the interstices of institutions and society (party transformation, petition and grievance mechanisms, advocacy campaigns, initiatives to expand what I call the shortlist of the possible) for moments of significant change. Agenda democracy compels the examination of democratizing agenda restrictions, the study of conservative organizations in politics, and the consideration of decomposing the term “movement.”","political_science"
"This review examines how legislators' race and ethnicity affect the representation of racial and ethnic minorities' interests and priorities in the mass public, how these legislators affect the political participation of these groups, how the presence of these candidates affects voter decision making, and how their prevalence impacts the composition of the parties and the nature of public policy. It also points to new directions and opportunities for scholarship on why minority legislators matter for American politics.","political_science"
"This article focuses on discussions in political theory on climate change in the period 2005–2015, setting them in the context of broader discussions in political theory on the environment and ecology in the period 1990–2005. The themes of justice, politics, and expertise are used to organize the review. It is argued that discussions of justice and climate change could benefit from a richer connection to the literature on historical injustice; that in discussions of the politics of climate change, a comparative advantage of political theory lies in further development of the role of ethos and imagination in reshaping our understanding of the place of the status quo; and that more research into the relationship between expertise and democracy is needed. In conclusion, the idea of the Anthropocene is considered, with the need for further consideration of politics in specifying how humans are transforming the nature of the earth and atmosphere.","political_science"
"The structure and governance of global supply chains not only shape social and environmental outcomes for both countries and firms, but also affect the quality of life at the local level, for those who live and work at each site of production. Existing literature on supply chain governance focuses on the transnational firm and has yielded a wide range of theoretical and empirical findings about firm- and nation-level outcomes. However, we know less about the drivers of variation in more localized social and environmental outcomes across production sites, which may result from local, national, and global actors and institutions that may interact. I provide a brief overview of the dominant literature on supply chain governance, highlighting the tendency to take an actor-centric approach. I then identify opportunities to study local social and environmental consequences of networked production using a more explicitly multi-actor and multi-level approach that can allow us to identify potential trade-offs, double wins, or spillovers between social and environmental outcomes.","political_science"
"Scholars have long been fascinated by the role of international courts in the enforcement of international rule of law. They start with a foundational question: Can international courts affect how international law is implemented? In this review, we lay out four of the most common theoretical arguments for why international courts matter. We then interrogate these accounts. In particular, we examine their views on how much influence courts have and what the likely welfare consequences are for the signatories of an agreement. In so doing, we identify critical conditions that must obtain for court influence under each of the arguments. We then bring more recent scholarship to bear on the plausibility of these conditions. In particular, we examine what research on the structure of law, the preferences of judges, and institutional design implies about the efficacy of international courts based on the four foundational arguments. We conclude with suggestions for future research.","political_science"
"Feminist theory is not only about women; it is about the world, engaged through critical intersectional perspectives. Despite many significant differences, most feminist theory is reliably suspicious of dualistic thinking, generally oriented toward fluid processes of emergence rather than static entities in one-way relationships, and committed to being a political as well as an intellectual enterprise. It is rooted in and responsible to movements for equality, freedom, and justice. Three important contemporary questions within feminist theory concern (a) subjectivity, narrative, and materiality; (b) global neoliberal geopolitics; and (c) global ecologies. Feminist theorists employ the tools of intersectionality, interdisciplinarity, and the intertwinings of scholarship and activism to address these questions. While we labor to contribute to our academic fields, our primary responsibility is to contribute to positive social change.","political_science"
"This article responds to a set of well-known challenges to empirical research on formal institutions in comparative politics. We focus on the case of written constitutions and discuss the scholarly utility of studying such documents in the face of four analytic and theoretical challenges. Each of these challenges, in turn, implies a set of empirical questions, for which we invoke original data to sketch a broad-brushed set of answers. The data analysis and accompanying discussion suggest a set of guidelines for how written constitutions should be deployed in comparative research designs on topics that involve political institutions.","political_science"
"Contact with the carceral state—ranging from police stops to prison time—is a frequent experience in the United States, particularly in communities marginalized on the basis of race and class. In recent years, political scientists have sought to measure the impacts of these encounters on individuals’ and communities’ political engagement. This review describes the main sources of evidence in this literature and what we learn from them. I present a series of stylized facts about the carceral state and political behavior, highlighting places where we know a great deal (such as the relative underrepresentation of people with criminal convictions among voters) and places where more work is needed (such as nonvoting participation and community spillovers). Then, I discuss policy proposals that seek to mitigate the political impacts of the carceral state, and what is and is not yet known about what they might accomplish.","political_science"
"The purpose of this review is to take stock of how party polarization affects governance in the United States. The article begins by defining polarization and discussing the means by which it can be measured. It is undeniable that the two parties have grown more sharply differentiated. Some evidence suggests that the substantive policy preferences of liberals and conservatives diverge more widely, but the case for ideological polarization in the spatial sense is not definitive. Effects on the institutional processes of US government have entailed a hardening of party divisions and a tendency toward centralization of power. Nevertheless, these more cohesive parties are not more effective than their predecessors at enacting policies or managing routine governing responsibilities. The consequences for public policy seem best characterized as “drift” ( Hacker 2004 , p. 246). There is little evidence that party polarization has promoted ideologically extreme policy outcomes or has systematically advantaged either liberalism or conservatism.","political_science"
"Leaders are part of virtually all organized political life. There have been important recent advances in modeling “leaders” as well as clever and innovative empirical studies. We review recent contributions from the political science, economics, and management literatures. We discuss the extent to which these new works represent advances over the major classic works on leadership and organization from the twentieth century. We identify important gaps, chief among them (a) theorizing a role for coercion, (b) modeling the endogenous emergence of leaders, and (c) empirically disentangling the effect of an individual leader from her office, especially when leaders emerge endogenously.","political_science"
"This article compares government responses to the Great Recession of 2008–2009 with government responses to recessions and other economic challenges in the period 1974–1982. We focus on five countries: France, Germany, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Across these countries, we observe two broad shifts in crisis responses. First, governments have in the recent period eschewed heterodox crisis policies and relied more exclusively on fiscal stimulus. Second, tax cuts have become a more important component of fiscal stimulus while spending cuts have featured more prominently in governments' efforts to consolidate their fiscal position. We argue that crisis responses reflect the interests and power of domestic actors as well as external constraints and the nature of the economic problems at hand.","political_science"
"Research on clientelism often starts from a shared puzzle: How can clientelism be a viable electoral strategy if voters can renege on their commitments to politicians? The standard solution proposed is that politicians resolve this commitment problem with voters through monitoring and enforcement. But there has been startlingly little evidence of individual-level monitoring and enforcement in the recent literature, and many studies now document the use of clientelism even where politicians are aware that the commitment problem remains completely intractable. When read together, recent studies suggest that the focus on resolving the commitment problem is a red herring. Instead, it is increasingly clear that clientelism does not need to be monitored and that the commitment problem does not bind as politicians choose their electoral appeals. New puzzles, motivated by advances in the recent literature, deserve comparatively more attention in future research.","political_science"
"This article considers the potential to use knowledge of expected electoral system effects to engage in electoral engineering. The review focuses on contributions made in the past dozen or so years and is limited to five specific questions: How do electoral systems affect (a) the proportionality of seats–votes relationships, (b) party proliferation, (c) the ideological nature of party competition, (d) voter turnout, and (e) the degree of match between the preferences of citizens and the policy choices of the government?","political_science"
"We review the literature on the rise of identity politics and populism in Europe. Populist parties have gained large vote shares since the Great Recession of 2008. We observe in many countries, and even in the European Parliament, a transformation of the main dimension of politics from the left–right cleavage to a new cleavage opposing the mainstream parties to populist parties. We examine how this transformation relates to changes in voter attitudes and the adjustment of political parties to these changes. Two main types of causes for the rise of populism have emerged: economic and cultural. In reviewing the evidence, we find a complex interaction between economic and cultural factors. Economic anxiety among large groups of voters related to the Great Recession and austerity policies triggers a heightened receptivity to the messages of cultural backlash from populist parties.","political_science"
"The Eurozone's present state of crisis originated from decisions made at its creation. The decision to create a monetary union was motivated by political objectives and completely disregarded the economics of a monetary union. Political leaders did not understand the necessary economic conditions for a successful monetary union and did not recognize the inherent fragility of the monetary union they established. They showed the same disturbing lack of understanding of the economics of the sovereign debt crisis in 2010. They misdiagnosed the problem, and their response included disastrous decisions that intensified the crisis. This review explains these errors and concludes with recommendations for saving the euro.","political_science"
"We consider the relationships between the collective preference and non-cooperative game theory approaches to positive political theory. In particular, we show that an apparently decisive difference between the two approaches—that in sufficiently complex environments (e.g. high-dimensional choice spaces) direct preference aggregation models are incapable of generating any prediction at all, whereas non-cooperative game-theoretic models almost always generate prediction—is indeed only an apparent difference. More generally, we argue that when modeling collective decisions there is a fundamental tension between insuring existence of well-defined predictions, a criterion of minimal democracy, and general applicability to complex environments; while any two of the three are compatible under either approach, neither collective preference nor non-cooperative game theory can support models that simultaneously satisfy all three desiderata.","political_science"
"How has populism transformed party systems in Europe? I survey the varieties of populism, the sources of their support and the different ways that they appeal to voters. I use data from the Chapel Hill Expert Survey to explore whether populist parties are intensifying competition on the cultural dimension, accelerating the decline of mainstream parties, and increasing polarization. I argue that while left and center populist parties have upended existing structures of competition, it is longstanding conservative parties, remodeled using ethnopopulism, that have been the most consequential for the substance of political competition and the trajectory of domestic politics. I consider the behavior of incumbents and argue that varieties of populism should shape our expectations of what happens when populists rule: While left populist parties in power over the last decade have tended to become more ordinary, sometimes even shedding antiestablishment and anti-EU positions, ethnopopulist parties in power have used harsh “us-versus-them” appeals, misinformation, and democratic backsliding in their pursuit of more power.","political_science"
"Post-2003 civil wars are different from previous civil wars in three striking ways. First, most of them are situated in Muslim-majority countries. Second, most of the rebel groups fighting these wars espouse radical Islamist ideas and goals. Third, most of these radical groups are pursuing transnational rather than national aims. Current civil war theories can explain some of what is going on, but not everything. In this article, I argue that the transformation of information technology, especially the advent of the Web 2.0 in the early 2000s, is the big new innovation that is likely driving many of these changes. I offer a theory to explain why rebel groups, especially those in Muslim countries, have chosen to pursue a particular type of extreme ideology and goals. I then identify the six big implications this new information environment is likely to have for rebel behavior in the future. Innovations in information and communication technology are currently manifesting themselves in the rise of global Jihadi groups in the Muslim world, but we can expect them to be exploited by other groups as well.","political_science"
"This review addresses key issues in the study of Latino politics. Foremost among these is the question of low voter turnout. Such factors as income, education, nativity, religion, political party, organizational involvement, neighborhood composition, ethnic attachments, and mobilization of Hispanic turnout have a limited impact on Hispanic votes. I suggest that this is due to differences in the political socialization of Latinos and Anglos. The review also shows that immigrants are focused on U.S. politics rather than home-country politics. Additionally, it describes significant differences regarding the factors that shape Hispanic versus Anglo partisanship. Among the other issues considered is the limited significance of ethnic factors, as compared to partisanship and state of residence, in determining electoral and policy preferences.","political_science"
"We review debates concerning the evolution and impact of parliamentary obstruction in the U.S. Senate, focusing on path dependency versus remote majoritarian perspectives. We consider the viability of circumventing supermajority requirements for rules changes by using rulings from the chair to establish precedents. Because the viability of this approach depends, at least in part, on the anticipated reaction of the public, we conduct a preliminary analysis of public opinion data from the 1940s through the 1960s and from the showdown over the obstruction of judicial nominees in 2005. We contend that the balance of the evidence favors the position that senators have generally supported the maintenance of the filibuster and have been able to make procedural adjustments when obstruction threatened a committed majority's top priorities, although we offer some important refinements required in comparing the historical operation of obstruction to its impact in today's Senate.","political_science"
"The past decade has seen a spate of new work on empire in political theory and the history of political thought. Much of this work has focused on the place of empire in the thought of many canonical thinkers and in the formation of modern liberalism and related arenas, such as postcolonial settler societies and the discipline of international law. Political theory's turn to empire has been belated in comparison to other fields, such as history, literature, and anthropology, which had been grappling with the histories and legacies of modern European empires since the 1970s. Despite intense attention to the question of American imperialism during the Bush administration, political theory arguably continues to fail to deal adequately with the imperial features of the current global order, including the substantial responsibility on the part of the great powers for conditions such as extreme poverty, ecological crisis, civil conflict, and tyranny around the world.","political_science"
"Transatlantic international relations (IR) theory has more or less neglected the international relations of East Asia. This relative neglect has come in different forms: excluding East Asian cases from analysis, including East Asian cases but miscoding or misunderstanding them, or including them but missing the fact that they do not confirm the main findings of the study. A review of the East Asia–related literature on three important clusters of theorizing—structural theories of conflict, institutional design and efficacy, and historical memory—suggests that this neglect of the region (and other regions) may come at a cost to transatlantic IR, not only in terms of data problems but also in terms of omitted or downplayed explanatory variables and theoretical arguments.","political_science"
"Works on the 1848 revolutions, 1989 collapse of European communism, 1998–2005 postcommunist color revolutions, and 2011 Arab uprisings frequently cross-reference each other, implying what is called here the concept of a “regime change cascade.” Research on these “Big Four” events shows that cascading can occur in protest calling for regime change as well as revolution in the name of regime change, but these rarely lead to actual regime change. Regime change cascades can occur through demonstration effects and active mediation, although common external causes and contemporaneous domestic triggers can cause events outwardly resembling them. Regime change cascades tend to occur where (a) there exists a common frame of political reference, (b) unpopular leaderships are becoming lame ducks; (c) elites lack other focal points for coordinated defection, and (d) structural conditions supporting a new regime type are in place. Cascading to hybrid regimes or autocracy may be more likely than cascading to democracy.","political_science"
"Canonical studies of the origins of state capacity have focused on macro-historical or structural explanations. I review recent research in historical political economy that showcases the role of politics—agents, their constraints, and their motivations—in the evolution of state capacity. Findings from both developed and developing countries emphasize how elite conflict, principal–agent dilemmas, and ethnic and racial differences have shaped agents’ preferences for capacity. These new studies demonstrate that state capacity can be strategically manipulated by political and economic elites, and that the various dimensions of state capacity—extractive, coercive, legal—do not necessarily move together. Refocusing our attention on the political drivers of state capacity has also shed light on why there are such stark subnational variations in the development of state capacity, particularly within large polities like India, China, and the United States. The findings point to the need for more nuanced conceptualization and measurement of state capacity.","political_science"
"Social scientists are now in an era of data abundance, and machine learning tools are increasingly used to extract meaning from data sets both massive and small. We explain how the inclusion of machine learning in the social sciences requires us to rethink not only applications of machine learning methods but also best practices in the social sciences. In contrast to the traditional tasks for machine learning in computer science and statistics, when machine learning is applied to social scientific data, it is used to discover new concepts, measure the prevalence of those concepts, assess causal effects, and make predictions. The abundance of data and resources facilitates the move away from a deductive social science to a more sequential, interactive, and ultimately inductive approach to inference. We explain how an agnostic approach to machine learning methods focused on the social science tasks facilitates progress across a wide range of questions.","political_science"
"One of the major developments in political science in the past decade has been the rise of experiments and surveys on political elites. Yet, the increase in the number of elite studies has outpaced our collective understanding of best practices and how we know a good elite experiment when we see one. In this article, we discuss some of the challenges in the study of political elites—from who counts as an elite to how to best utilize elite experiments in the context of broader research designs. We also offer recommendations on questions of access, recruitment, and representativeness, as well as designs that researchers can use to study “eliteness” without access to elites.","political_science"
"Explorations of political attitudes and ideologies have sought to explain where they come from. They have been presumed to be rooted in processes of socialization; to be imposed by elites through partisan affiliations, the social milieu, and experiences; or to result from psychological traits. Far less attention has been focused on the inherent component of attitudes and where attitudes lead. Synthesizing research across academic fields, we propose that attitudes are a core constituent element of individual temperament, with far-reaching influence on many aspects of psychological and social functioning. Once instantiated, political values guide human behavior across domains, including affiliation into social networks, mate selection, physiological perception, psychological disposition, personality characteristics, morality construction, decision making, and selection into the very environments that influence political preferences. Here, we reconceptualize the ontology of political attitudes and ideologies from both a top-down and bottom-up perspective and as a combination of biological and environmental processes that drive an entire suite of coordinated downstream effects across the life course.","political_science"
"The growth in economic sanctions has been matched by a surge in scholarly research. This article reviews the current state of scholarship on economic sanctions to see where the literature has advanced since Baldwin's Economic Statecraft—and where there is need for further research. Over the past few decades, sanctions scholarship has made its greatest strides in investigating the effects and effectiveness of economic coercion attempts. This vein of research suggests that economic coercion is more effective than previously believed—but at the same time, the policy externalities of sanctions are far greater than previously understood. There remain many fruitful areas of research. Scholars need to consider how to better measure the deterrent effects of economic sanctions over time. Claims that there are different national styles of economic statecraft need to be tested to determine whether these styles are enduring or ephemeral. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, international relations scholars need to consider the systemic implications of increased sanctioning behavior. Scholars need to assess when and how sanctions affect the broader global political economy.","political_science"
"Most democratic theories recognize that democracy requires widespread adherence to both formal and informal norms that constrain the use of power and structure relationships among citizens. Most also recognize that a healthy democracy requires some forms of activism or resistance that transgress those norms to disrupt hierarchies, challenge injustices, and drive discursive innovation. Recent systemic theories of democracy show that democratic theory can incorporate these two realities without contradiction, but it is not clear whether an ethic of citizenship can do the same. This article reviews recent literature on the purposes and ethics of transgressive politics while also drawing attention to neglected questions about the functions of democratic norms and how they are maintained amid transgressions. These are questions that must be addressed by an ethic of citizenship that can navigate the tension between the authority of democratic norms and the constructive potential of transgressive politics.","political_science"

"Spatial models are ubiquitous within political science. Whenever we confront spatial models with data, we need valid and reliable ways to measure policy positions in political space. I first review a range of general issues that must be resolved before thinking about how to measure policy positions, including cognitive metrics, a priori and a posteriori scale interpretation, dimensionality, common spaces, and comparability across settings. I then briefly review different types of data we can use to do this and measurement techniques associated with each type, focusing on headline issues with each type of data and pointing to comprehensive surveys of relevant literatures—including expert, elite, and mass surveys; text analysis; and legislative voting behavior.","political_science"
"Authoritarian regimes become more likely to democratize when they face little choice or little risk. In some cases, the risk of democratization to authoritarian incumbents is so low that ending authoritarianism might not mean exiting power at all. This article develops a unified theory of authoritarian-led democratization under conditions of relatively low incumbent risk. We argue that the party strength of the authoritarian incumbent is the most pivotal factor in authoritarian-led democratization. When incumbent party strength has been substantial enough to give incumbent authoritarian politicians significant electoral victory confidence, nondemocratic regimes have pursued reversible democratic experiments that eventually culminated in stable, thriving democracies. Evidence from Europe's first wave of democratization and more recent democratic transitions in Taiwan and Ghana illustrate how party strength has underpinned authoritarian-led democratization across the world and across modern history.","political_science"
"A significant and growing literature on international relations (IR) argues that domestic politics is typically an important part of the explanation for states' foreign policies, and seeks to understand its influence more precisely. I argue that what constitutes a “domestic-political” explanation of a state's foreign policy choices has not been clearly elaborated. What counts as a domestic-political explanation is defined by opposition to systemic or structural explanations. But these may be specified in several different ways—I spell out two—each of which implies a different concept of domestic-political explanations. If a systemic IR theory pictures states as unitary, rational actors, then a domestic-political explanation is one in which domestic-political interactions in at least one state yield a suboptimal foreign policy relative to some normative standard. Or, if a systemic IR theory pictures states as unitary, rational actors and also requires that attributes of particular states not enter the explanation, then a domestic-political explanation is any one that involves state characteristics other than relative power. Implications of each approach are developed, and examples from the literature are provided. I also address the question of whether there is a sharp distinction between a “systemic theory of international politics” and a “theory of foreign policy,” arguing that there is an important and natural sense in which they are the same.","political_science"
"This article provides an overview of the emerging field of American political economy (APE). Methodologically eclectic, this field seeks to understand the interaction of markets and government in America's unequal and polarized polity. Though situated within American politics research, APE draws from comparative political economy to develop a broad approach that departs from the American politics mainstream in two main ways. First, APE focuses on the interaction of markets and governance, a peripheral concern in much American politics research. Second, it invokes a theoretical orientation attentive to what we call meta politics—the processes of institution shaping, agenda setting, and venue shopping that unfold before and alongside the more visible processes of mass politics that figure so centrally in American politics research. These substantive and theoretical differences expand the study of American politics into neglected yet vital domains, generating fresh insights into the United States’ distinctive mix of capitalism and democracy.","political_science"
"Scholarship on the politics of secrecy in international relations and foreign policy has experienced tremendous growth in recent years. This article begins by providing an overview of this literature, analyzing the conditions under which leaders opt for secrecy in both economic and security domains. These motivations differ greatly depending on whether the presumed audience from which a leader keeps a secret is domestic, international, or corporate in nature. Next, it considers methodological innovations and challenges, particularly in the measurement of secrecy. Finally, it reflects on the lessons learned and discusses some exciting questions that scholars could explore in future research. As a burgeoning field within international relations, the study of secrecy offers a variety of promising and potentially fruitful directions.","political_science"
"Scholars continue to disagree about the relationship between economic development and democracy. I review the history of the debate and summarize patterns visible in data available today. I find a strong and consistent relationship between higher income and both democratization and democratic survival in the medium term (10–20 years), but not necessarily in shorter time windows. Building on several recent studies, I sketch out a new conditional modernization theory, which can account for such lags. The key idea is that the effect of development on democracy is triggered by disruptive events such as economic crises, military defeats, or—most generally—leader change. Political outcomes depend on both the development level and, at intermediate income ranges, how citizens coordinate. Waves of leader turnover in autocracies correlate with temporarily stronger links between income and democratization, which, in turn, coincide with the first two waves of democracy.","political_science"
"How are the contours of Western European politics shifting? To what extent do these shifts reflect changes in the underlying social and economic structure of European polities? In this article, we reflect on insights from the classic literature on how cleavages structure party systems and consider how the emergence and persistence of new parties and new ideological conflicts are leading to both shifts of dividing lines of party competition and the fragmentation of party systems. While increasing attention has been given to the so-called second dimension of European electoral politics, we highlight the relatively limited focus on structural changes that are helping to drive this transformation. We identify some socio-demographic developments that are potentially generating new cleavages in Western European democracies: the expansion of higher education; mass migration and the growing ethnic diversity of electorates; the aging of societies and sharpening of generational divides; and increased geographical segregation of populations between prospering, globalized major cities and declining hinterlands.","political_science"
"Many theorists have long extolled the virtues of public deliberation as a crucial component of a responsive and responsible democracy. Building on these theories, in recent years practitioners—from government officials to citizen groups, nonprofits, and foundations—have increasingly devoted time and resources to strengthening citizen engagement through deliberative forums. Although empirical research has lagged behind theory and practice, a body of literature has emerged that tests the presumed individual and collective benefits of public discourse on citizen engagement. We begin our review of this research by defining “public deliberation”; we place it in the context of other forms of what we call “discursive participation” while distinguishing it from other ways in which citizens can voice their individual and collective views on public issues. We then discuss the expectations, drawn from deliberative democratic theory, regarding the benefits (and, for some, pitfalls) assumed to derive from public deliberation. The next section reviews empirical research as it relates to these theoretical expectations. We conclude with recommendations on future directions for research in this area.","political_science"
"This article examines the concepts of group membership, group identity and racial identity, and group consciousness. For each of these we discuss theoretical definitions, research using the various definitions, and issues of measurement. We show that these concepts are distinct and build on each other, rather than being interchangeable. We also explore the concept of linked fate, which evolved from the concept of group consciousness and is central in the race and politics literature. Finally, we address the very important question of whether we are in danger of overextrapolation—taking concepts developed in research on one group and grafting them onto other groups.","political_science"
"The spatial model of elections identifies factors that motivate party elites to shift their policy positions, including changes in voters' policy preferences, rival parties' policy shifts, past election results, and changes in party elites' valence images with respect to dimensions of evaluation such as competence and integrity. I review empirical studies on multiparty elections, i.e., elections involving three or more major parties, that evaluate party elites' policy responses to these factors, along with empirical studies on the electoral consequences of parties' policy shifts. This review reveals a paradox: on the one hand, empirical studies conclude that parties systematically shift their policy positions in response to the factors that spatial modelers have identified. On the other hand, there is only weak and inconsistent empirical evidence that voters actually perceive parties' policy shifts, and/or that these shifts have significant electoral consequences. Thus the predictions of spatial theory are largely verified, whereas the assumptions that underpin spatial theory are called into question.","political_science"
"What are the political and economic consequences of contention (i.e., genocide, civil war, state repression/human rights violation, terrorism, and protest)? Despite a significant amount of interest as well as quantitative research, the literature on this subject remains underdeveloped and imbalanced across topic areas. To date, investigations have been focused on particular forms of contention and specific consequences. While this research has led to some important insights, substantial limitations—as well as opportunities for future development—remain. In particular, there is a need for simultaneously investigating a wider range of consequences (beyond democracy and economic development), a wider range of contentious activity (beyond civil war, protest, and terrorism), a wider range of units of analysis (beyond the nation year), and a wider range of empirical approaches in order to handle particular difficulties confronting this type of inquiry (beyond ordinary least-squares regression). Only then will we have a better and more comprehensive understanding of what contention does and does not do politically and economically. This review takes stock of existing research and lays out an approach for looking at the problem using a more comprehensive perspective.","political_science"
"What does it mean to identify with a social group? Are individuals’ group attachments tied to material or nonmaterial payoffs? What is the existing evidence for social identification due to nonmaterial payoffs? When do identities matter and for what sorts of behaviors? We highlight findings from several literatures in political science, ranging from voting and redistribution to violence and conflict, focusing on nonmaterial, identity-based motivations for behavior in these domains. Doing so allows us to draw out commonalities across research areas that are often held in isolation from one another and that frequently employ overlapping terminology. We summarize important findings and identify open questions; these questions include what the role played by elites is in shaping mass mobilization around identities and what the relationship is between social identities and social norms.","political_science"
"In recent years, there has been a surge in the study of representation and elections in local politics. Scholars have made progress on many of the empirical barriers that stymied earlier researchers. As a result, the study of representation and elections in local politics has moved squarely into the center of American politics. The findings of recent research show that local politics in the modern, polarized era is much more similar to other areas of American politics than previously believed. Scholars have shown that partisanship and ideology play important roles in local politics. Due to the growing ideological divergence between Democrats and Republicans, Democratic elected officials increasingly take more liberal positions, and enact more liberal policies, than Republican ones. As a result, despite the multitude of constraints on local governments, local policies in the modern era tend to largely reflect the partisan and ideological composition of their electorates.","political_science"

To address these questions, I start with the pioneer studies of Powell and Jackman and then review more recent research. This essay seeks to establish which propositions about the causes of variations in turnout are consistently supported by empirical evidence and which ones remain ambiguous. I point out some enigmas and gaps in the field and suggest directions for future research. Most of the research pertains to established democracies, but analyses of nonestablished democracies are also included here.","political_science"
"Prospect theory is the most influential behavioral theory of choice in the social sciences. Its creators won a Nobel Prize in economics, and it is largely responsible for the booming field of behavioral economics. Although international relations theorists who study security have used prospect theory extensively, Americanists, comparativists, and political economists have shown little interest in it. The dominant explanation for political scientists' tepid response focuses on the theoretical problems with extending a theory devised in the lab to explain political decisions in the field. This essay focuses on these problems and reviews suggested solutions. It suggests that prospect theory's failure to ignite the imagination of more political scientists probably results from their aversion to behavioral assumptions and not from problems unique to prospect theory.","political_science"
"For decades, scholars have uncovered evidence that male and female legislators' priorities and preferences differ and that women's inclusion brings to elite-level politics a more cooperative leadership style. They also point to the symbolic benefits associated with more diversity among candidates and office holders. Although these effects are not uniform, there is no question among political scientists that women's presence in US political institutions bears directly on issues of substantive and symbolic representation. Accordingly, it is important to understand why we have so few women in politics, whether they are willing to run for office, what happens when they do, and the extent to which their presence systematically affects the legislative process. I cover each of these topics in this review, emphasizing the latest and most interesting research that speaks to these questions.","political_science"
"Third-generation theories of revolution pointed to the structural vulnerabilities of regimes as the basic causes of revolutions. In the last decade, critics of structural theories have argued for the need to incorporate leadership, ideology, and processes of identification with revolutionary movements as key elements in the production of revolution. Analyses of revolutions in developing countries and in communist regimes have further argued for incorporating these factors and for the inadequacy of structural theories to account for these events. Rather than try to develop a list of the “causes” of revolutions, it may be more fruitful for the fourth generation of revolutionary theory to treat revolutions as emergent phenomena, and to start by focusing on factors that cement regime stability. Weakness in those factors then opens the way for revolutionary leadership, ideology, and identification, along with structural factors such as international pressure and elite conflicts, to create revolutions.","political_science"
"Revolutions may be defined as periods in which the rate of change of power positions of factions, social groups, or armed bodies changes rapidly and unpredictably. Revolutions then come to an end to the degree that political uncertainty is reduced by building enough bargains into a political structure that can maintain those bargains. The paper summarizes what we know about the structures that can produce such decreases in uncertainty: conservative authoritarianism, independence, occupation government, totalitarianism, democracy, and caudillismo. The essay describes these governmental types by how they increase certainty of power distributions in the short and medium run and so bring revolutions to an end.","political_science"
"Bureaucracy is everywhere. Unelected bureaucrats are a key link between government and citizens, between policy and implementation. Bureaucratic politics constitutes a growing share of research in political science. But the way bureaucracy is studied varies widely, permitting theoretical and empirical blind spots as well as opportunities for innovation. Scholars of American politics tend to focus on bureaucratic policy making at the national level, while comparativists often home in on local implementation by street-level bureaucrats. Data availability and professional incentives have reinforced these subfield-specific blind spots over time. We highlight these divides in three prominent research areas: the selection and retention of bureaucratic personnel, oversight of bureaucratic activities, and opportunities for influence by actors external to the bureaucracy. Our survey reveals how scholars from the American and comparative politics traditions can learn from one another.","political_science"
"This article reviews the state of the literature on the politics of global health governance and associated political dynamics of actors involved in this issue space. We identify seven eras in the field, beginning with the period of empire and colonialism and ending with the COVID-19 outbreak. The field of global health has long had a focus on infectious disease, often rooted within a state-centered approach to transnational global health problems with recurrent debates about whether and how restrictions on trade and travel should be imposed in the wake of disease outbreaks. This statist focus is in tension with more cosmopolitan visions of global health, which require broader health system strengthening. In the mid-2000s, a golden age emerged with the influx of new financing and political attention to addressing HIV/AIDS and malaria, as well as reducing the risk posed by infectious disease outbreaks to economies of the Global North. Despite increased awareness of noncommunicable diseases and the importance of health systems, events of recent years (including but not limited to the COVID-19 outbreak) reinforced the centrality of states to global health efforts and the primacy of infectious diseases.","political_science"

"Richard E. Neustadt is the author of one of the most influential books ever written about political leadership. Headed for a career as a political-level bureaucrat, he “drifted” to academia after the 1952 election brought a Republican to the White House. He observed a disconnect between what he had experienced in the executive branch in Washington and what was then written about the Presidency. He decided to write a book that would close this gap and, in doing so, contribute to political science. Presidential Power was the product of this effort, a book that continues to dominate the thinking about leadership in the White House. This essay focuses on the career and writings of Neustadt, including an analysis of his critics and his responses. It incorporates the results of two interviews with Neustadt.","political_science"
"As laboratories, states are faced with a new agenda of social experimentation. This article first considers state elections and parties, including state realignment, party endorsements and primary elections, uncontested seats, and campaign finance. A second topic is the governorship, including governors' careers, changes in power, party leadership, and legislative programs and tactics used in negotiating with legislators. A third section considers the state legislatures, including term limits, professionalism, leadership, committees, roll-call voting, and representation. Another subject closely related to all aspects is the variety and organization of interest groups, their power, and whom they represent. The conclusion is that the states as laboratories are now equipped to handle the social experimentation that devolution has handed down to them.","political_science"
"This article treats the analysis of “time-series–cross-section” (TSCS) data, which has become popular in the empirical analysis of comparative politics and international relations (IR). Such data consist of repeated observations on a series of fixed (nonsampled) units, where the units are of interest in themselves. An example of TSCS data is the post–World War II annual observations on the political economy of OECD nations. TSCS data are also becoming more common in IR studies that use the “dyad-year” design; such data are often complicated by a binary dependent variable (the presence or absence of dyadic conflict). Among the issues considered here are estimation and specification. I argue that treating TSCS issues as an estimation nuisance is old-fashioned; those wishing to pursue this approach should use ordinary least squares with panel correct standard errors rather than generalized least squares. A modern approach models dynamics via a lagged dependent variable or a single equation error correction model. Other modern issues involve the modeling of spatial impacts (geography) and heterogeneity. The binary dependent variable common in IR can be handled by treating the TSCS data as event history data.","political_science"
"The United States has undergone a profound spatial reorganization over the course of the twentieth century, and it influences the working of democratic and judicial institutions profoundly. The critical feature is differential access to transportation and place, and the major instrument is of course the automobile. Other technologies—the AC electric grid most fundamental among them—have allowed a finer and finer sorting of the population into relatively homogeneous income strata. The failure of Brown v. Board of Education (1954) is a leading example of this phenomenon. The trivialization of local politics—when resources are separated from needs in a region—is another.","political_science"
"Given the global trend of increasing ethnocultural diversity and the outbreak of nationalist movements based on cultural, linguistic, and territorial identities, this review focuses on social and political mechanisms that lead to the emergence of minority group collective action. This kind of collective action is seen as a function of three necessary conditions: the formation of distinctive social identities, the overcoming of free riding, and the development of institutional structures promoting the demand for greater autonomy. The article examines the debates, theories, and empirical evidence concerning these three conditions. We conclude by noting that the most important impediment to progress in this field is the relative paucity of historical and cross-national databases that are required to test many of the theories in the literature.","political_science"
"Within the past 25 years, climate change has evolved from an issue of interest primarily to some natural scientists into one of the top priorities on the global policy agenda. Research in political science and related fields offers systematic and empirically well-supported explanations for why solving the climate problem has turned out to be more difficult than originally anticipated. After reviewing this research, I focus on four areas in which we know less: (a) institutional design features that may help in mitigating or overcoming fundamental problems in the global cooperative effort; (b) factors that are driving variation in climate policies at national and subnational levels; (c) driving forces of climate policy beyond the state, in particular civil society, the science–policy interface, and public opinion; and (d) sociopolitical consequences of failing to avoid major climatic changes. The article concludes by identifying key questions at the micro, meso, and macro levels that should be addressed by political scientists in the coming years. In view of the fact that governance efforts at the global level are progressing very slowly, greater attention to bottom-up dynamics appears useful, both for analytical reasons (there is lots of variation to be explained) and for normative reasons.","political_science"
"In recent years, the judicialization of politics worldwide has expanded its scope to encompass what we may term “mega-politics”—matters of outright and utmost political significance that often define and divide whole polities. In this article, I explore the scope and nature of judicialization of this kind. I begin by identifying the characteristics of the judicialization of mega-politics and by surveying the main explanations for its emergence. I then illustrate the various forms and manifestations of the judicialization of mega-politics through recent examples drawn from jurisprudence of courts and tribunals worldwide. Next, I explore recent studies that advance a strategic “judicialization-from-above” account, which emphasizes support from the political sphere as a necessary precondition for judicialization of pure politics. To further illustrate this point, I survey patterns of political reaction to recurrent manifestations of unsolicited judicial intervention in the political sphere in general, and unwelcome judgments concerning contentious political issues in particular.","political_science"
"International relations theory has long seen the origins, conduct, and termination of war as a bargaining process. Recent formal work on these issues draws very heavily on Rubinstein's (1982) seminal analysis of the bargaining problem and the research that flowed from it. There is now what might be called a standard or canonical model of the origins of war that sees this outcome as a bargaining breakdown. This essay reviews this standard model and current efforts to extend it to the areas of (a) multilateral bargaining, which is at the heart of old issues such as balancing and bandwagoning as well as newer ones such as the role of third-party mediation; (b) the effects of domestic politics on international outcomes; (c) efforts to explicitly model intra-war bargaining; and (d) dynamic commitment problems.","political_science"
"This essay synthesizes the results of the large number of studies of late–20th-century democratization published during the last 20 years. Strong evidence supports the claims that democracy is more likely in more developed countries and that regime transitions of all kinds are more likely during economic downturns. Very few of the other arguments advanced in the transitions literature, however, appear to be generally true. This study proposes a theoretical model, rooted in characteristics of different types of authoritarian regimes, to explain many of the differences in democratization experience across cases in different regions. Evidence drawn from a data set that includes 163 authoritarian regimes offers preliminary support for the model proposed.","political_science"
"Recent work on the history of political thought, exploiting digital resources, is challenging the idea that empirically and hermeneutically minded political scientists must work independently in silos. Work by students of the Cambridge School and work by textual data miners are showing the way toward a new hermeneutical circle—one in which empirically and hermeneutically minded political scientists can use digital resources to analyze diverse texts and make groundbreaking discoveries on relationships between textual uses of language and political change. I analyze this new trend toward different sorts of political scientists using digital resources to study ideas, to outline underlying paradigms relating language and politics in these respective fields, and to consider how they could be brought into productive conversation. I then consider how such conversation would enrich subdisciplinary understandings of the role of language in politics. Ultimately, I use this analysis to generate a broader model for how empirically and hermeneutically inclined political scientists can benefit from collaboration in the age of digital humanities.","political_science"
"Michael Oakeshott (1901–1990) achieved arguably the most sophisticated philosophical understanding of politics in recent times. His characteristic skepticism extended to the possibility of creating a genuine science of politics. This chapter sketches the development of his conception of political understanding. It begins with his early elaboration of the modal character of all knowledge, discusses his criticism of rationalism and reflections on the appropriate curriculum for studying politics in a university. It concludes by examining the theoretical basis of his rejection of the idea that politics could be analyzed as a field governed by natural laws.","political_science"
"The objectivist truth claims traditionally pressed by most political scientists have made the use of ethnographic methods particularly fraught in the discipline. This article explores what ethnography as a method entails. It makes distinctions between positivist and interpretivist ethnographies and highlights some of the substantive contributions ethnography has made to the study of politics. Lamenting the discipline's abandonment of a conversation with anthropology after Geertz, this review also insists on moving beyond the anthropological controversies so powerfully expressed in the edited volume Writing Culture (1986) and other texts of the 1980s and 1990s. I contend that interpretive social science does not have to forswear generalizations or causal explanations and that ethnographic methods can be used in the service of establishing them. Rather than fleeing from abstractions, ethnographies can and should help ground them.","political_science"
"What do we know about wealth inequality and democracy? Our review shows that the simple conjectures that democracy produces wealth equality and that wealth inequality leads to democratic failure are not supported by the evidence. Why are democracy and high levels of wealth inequality sustainable together? Three key features of democratic politics can make this outcome possible. When societies are divided along cleavages other than wealth, this can inhibit the adoption of wealth-equalizing policies. Likewise, voter preferences for the redistribution of wealth depend on the beliefs they form about the fairness of these measures, and some voters without wealth may feel that redistribution is unfair. Finally, wealth-equalizing policies may be absent if the democratic process is captured by the rich; however, the evidence explaining when, where, and why capture accounts for variation in wealth inequality is less convincing than is often claimed. This phenomenon is a useful avenue for future research.","political_science"
"With the enormous expansion of scholarship on this subject, “rule of law” has come to mean different things—ranging from security and order to the operations of courts and the administration of justice. We review the various streams of theoretical and empirical research by academics and practitioners, emphasizing the connections to economic development. The core logic is that security of property rights and integrity of contract underpin, respectively, investment and trade, which in turn fuel economic growth and development. However, property rights and contracts rest on institutions, which themselves rest on coalitions of interests. Formal institutions are important, but, particularly in developing countries, informal institutional arrangements play a significant part as well. These considerations lead us to caution against an exaggerated confidence in the ability of development assistance to implant new institutions for the rule of law.","political_science"
"Since the first half of the twentieth century, whites have become much more accepting of the principle of racial equality even as they have continued to endorse negative racial stereotypes about African-Americans. Some scholars argue that this ambivalence has been exploited by contemporary political elites who have learned to fashion subtle racial appeals that activate these latent attitudes without appearing to violate widely held norms of racial equality. This strategy has been dubbed racial priming. In this brief article, we summarize and evaluate the work in this area, with a particular emphasis on studies that employ experimental research designs.","political_science"
"In research on American politics, the use of geographic information systems (GIS) is most often thought of in connection with redistricting and the study of election results. In the past ten years, political scientists have realized that GIS can help them address many research questions and data analysis tasks quite apart from these traditional applications. These include the analysis of point patterns and the detection of clustering; the study of diffusion of influence; and the measurement of spatial relationships involving key constructs such as proximity and distance, flow, and interaction. GIS tools also prove to be the exploratory complements to the suite of tools being used in spatial econometrics to test explicit hypotheses about the impact of geography and spatial arrangement on political outcomes.","political_science"
"We review a large formal literature on economic models of voting and electoral politics. We discuss two broad classes of model: those focusing on preference aggregation and those that look at elections as mechanisms of information aggregation. We also explore the role of elections in situations of asymmetric information, where politicians take hidden actions or are otherwise better informed about policy than voters are, and examine the role of elections in selection and as incentive mechanisms. In the section on models of preference aggregation, we focus on the themes of exogenous candidacy, policy commitment, and the role of valence attributes. For information aggregation, we analyze how different aspects of the institutional environment affect aggregation, focusing on the structure of elections—whether simultaneous or sequential—and the number of choices, as well as the motivations of voters. Finally, in considering models of asymmetric information, we describe how these models shed new light on incumbency effects, campaign spending, and the policy choices of politicians.","political_science"
"The fiscal sociology literature views the state at the heart of development, but in most developing countries, formal taxation is limited. Instead, local residents make substantial contributions outside the state to the provision of public goods. That is, they engage in what we call social extraction rather than state taxation. This article conceptualizes social extraction and the social institutions that drive extraction. Furthermore, it considers variations in the content of social institutions, and it proposes research agendas that allow us to understand how social institutions impact resource mobilization and development at the community level. It draws lessons from a large, cross-disciplinary literature that includes work in anthropology, sociology, economics, psychology, and political science.","political_science"
"To what extent are Internet users resilient to online censorship? When does censorship influence consumption of information and when does it create backlash? Drawing on a growing literature on Internet users’ reactions to censorship, I posit that awareness of censorship, incentives to seek out information, and resources to circumvent censorship are essential to resilience to censorship. I describe how authoritarian regimes have adapted their strategies of censorship to reduce both awareness of censorship and demand for uncensored information.","political_science"
"Competitive elections create a relationship of formal accountability between policy makers and citizens. Recent theoretical work suggests that there are limits on how well this formal accountability links policy decisions to citizen preferences. In particular, incumbents' incentives are driven not by the voters' evaluation of the normative desirability of outcomes but by the outcome's information about the incumbent's type (e.g., competence or ideology). This review surveys both this body of theory and the robust empirical literature it has spawned. It concludes with a short discussion of ongoing work that attempts to integrate this theoretical perspective with a richer view of policy-making institutions.","political_science"
"Political science research on indigenous peoples' politics in Latin America is methodologically diverse and interdisciplinary. It has produced significant insights about citizenship, reform of the state, and the causes and consequences of the emergence and success of identity-based social movements and political parties. In order to expand and deepen our knowledge, future research should pursue three goals. First, scholars should explore a wider selection of cases, including countries where indigenous populations are small and where dramatic events have not occurred, in order to better explain more common types of indigenous political mobilization in the region. Second, they should better connect the study of indigenous politics to that of Afro-descendent movements and gender and, thus, expand our understanding of racial and gender politics. Third, they should be more critical of the democratic performance of indigenous organizations and politicians, especially when they hold public office.","political_science"
"Democracy requires collective action—but not all forms of collective action are the same. Scholars need a more coherent intellectual infrastructure to differentiate distinct forms of collective action and to identify the kinds of collective action that enable democracy. We distinguish between two types of collective action: organizing, which seeks to transform individuals and groups into effective agents who can shape public outcomes, and mobilizing, which seeks to aggregate and articulate preferences in the public sphere with no explicit focus on individual or organizational change. We review work identifying the dimensions of possible transformation at the micro, meso, and macro levels, and existing evidence for it. We urge scholars to study organizing separate from (and in comparison to) mobilizing and suggest possible research strategies and questions. In doing so, we aim to provide a foundation for future research on organizing and its relationship to democracy.","political_science"
"This article argues that conflict rather than consensus defines the history of African American political thought. Its seminal figures have pursued justice along different and diverging lines—including advocating reformist, realist, and nationalist paths. While there is agreement that white supremacy is a form of social, economic, and political domination that should be eradicated, there is disagreement regarding its nature, effects, and resilience. This variance in judgments and inferences regarding the foundations and consequences of white supremacy leads to different accounts of social change, diverging strategic advice for realizing that change, and conflicting political theories. To press this claim, I consider the conflicting political visions of Booker T. Washington (1856–1915), W.E.B. Du Bois (1868–1963), and Marcus Garvey (1887–1940).","political_science"
"When, why, and how do countries move from hostile to peaceful relations, and sometimes even friendship? We draw on the interstate peace literature to identify two peace processes. Rapprochement represents a first step during which enemies might develop normal working relations. Some states then progress to conciliation and establish warm and cooperative ties. We compare rapprochement to conciliation, outline the mechanisms that drive each process, and review scholarly findings about three types of causal variables: abrupt shocks, stable contextual factors, and policy initiatives. A key insight emerges that conciliation is not simply an extension of rapprochement—the predictors of these two processes differ significantly. We then call for greater scholarly attention to the study of conciliation, interactions of causal factors, the domestic politics underlying each process, the causes of peace failure, and empirical and methodological challenges.","political_science"
"One key question driving innovations in corruption studies is how anticorruption reforms can be more impactful and sustainable. This is critical to understand due to the detrimental impact of corrupt practices on equality, human rights, peace, and the rule of law. A significant body of research has shown that many anticorruption initiatives do not produce the expected effect, or they achieve results that fade after the intervention ceases. Seeking to understand how to improve anticorruption outcomes, scholars have turned to causal explanations of the persistence of corruption ranging from institutional settings and individual motives to informal practices and social norms. This article explores the intersection of social norms and corruption as a contribution to improving anticorruption programming. It explains how norms impact our conceptual understanding of corruption and the vicious cycle that exists between corrupt practices and norms. Grounded in the belief that programming and social norm diagnosis need to be contextually driven, we lay out the nascent research on changing social norms that drive corruption and the consequences of ignoring them.","political_science"

How we define this fast-growing group and how it is situated in the broader racial landscape are critical to understanding its politics.

These two research areas provide important context for the rest of the review, which covers three additional themes: ( a) political participation; ( b) partisanship, vote choice, and issue orientations; and ( c) political representation. The last section returns to the theme of racial position, including its role in contemporary Asian American activism and its centrality to future research in the field.","political_science"
"The last two decades have seen a revival in work that takes the role of individual leaders and elites seriously. This article surveys new research that explores how biographical factors influence their behavior. We call this literature the personal biography approach to political leadership. Our survey first lays out four mechanisms through which biographical characteristics might affect leader behavior. We then discuss the main findings, grouping them according to socializing experiences (e.g., education, military service, and prior occupation) and ascriptive traits (e.g., gender, race, and ethnicity). We also consider the methodological problems, especially endogeneity and selection effects, that pose challenges to this style of research. We conclude with an assessment of gaps in the literature and provide suggestions for future work in the biographical vein.","political_science"

"Medieval Western Europeans developed two practices that are the bedrock of modern democracy: representative government and the consent of the governed. Why did this happen in Europe and not elsewhere? I ask what the literature has to say about this question, focusing on the role of political ideas, on economic development, and on warfare. I consider Europe in comparison with the Byzantine Empire, the Abbasid Caliphate, and Song Dynasty China. I argue that ultimately Europe's different path may have been an accident. It was produced by Western Europe's experience of outside invasion that replaced the Western Roman Empire with a set of small, fragmented polities in which rulers were relatively weak. Small size meant low transaction costs for maintaining assemblies. The relatively weak position of rulers meant that consent of the governed was necessary. I also suggest how these conclusions should influence our understanding of democracy today.","political_science"
"This article analyzes voter identification laws in the United States and their effects on voter turnout. Theoretically, there are plausible reasons to hypothesize turnout lowering effects, though there are also reasons to hypothesize those effects might be minimal. Methodologically, there are research design hurdles to clear in order to produce effect estimates that may be attributed to voter identification laws. Empirically, a small number of studies have employed suitable research designs and generally find modest, if any, turnout effects of voter identification laws. This may indicate that voter identification laws have only minor effects on turnout, or it may be due to the fact that the type of voter identification law that may have the most significant effects—a strict photo identification law—is a relatively recent phenomenon. Future elections and the related additional data may make it possible to adjudicate among these possibilities.","political_science"
"The Rochester school of political science, led by William H Riker, pioneered the new method of positive political theory. Positive political theory, or rational choice theory, represents the attempt to build formal models of collective decision-making processes, often relying on the assumption of self-interested rational action. This method has been used to study such political processes as elections, legislative behavior, public goods, and treaty formation and diplomatic strategy in international relations. In this article, we provide a retrospective account of the Rochester school, which discusses Riker's theoretical synthesis and his institution building in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. We discuss some of the most important Rochester school contributions related to spatial models of voting, agenda setting, structure-induced equilibria, heresthetics, game theory, and political theory. We also briefly situate positive political theory within the larger context of political science and economics.","political_science"
"Recent research has argued that the American welfare state is not necessarily smaller than the welfare state in other advanced industrial countries. Rather, it is organized on principles that make it seem smaller: Because it functions through tax expenditures and public–private partnerships, it is less visible than welfare states that operate on the principle of direct spending. This review summarizes the most important messages of this revisionist scholarship, particularly in how this form of welfare provision undermines support for the welfare state, increases the complexity and decreases the efficiency of the system, and hides regressive policies from public scrutiny. I then argue that although this work has taught us much about American politics, several gaps need to be addressed. First, the explanation of the origins of this state of affairs is incomplete and unconvincing. Second, while private welfare is an important part of the American experience, the scholarship on private welfare provision has not yet grappled with the fact that private welfare was also historically found in many other advanced industrial countries, but did not crowd out the public welfare state there as it has in the United States. Finally, although the scholarship has usefully called attention to the invisibility of tax expenditures, we should not consider tax expenditures part of the “welfare state,” because they only rarely accomplish the functions of redistribution and risk pooling of public welfare programs. Rather, in most cases, tax expenditures should be seen as tax cuts, that is, diminishment of state capacity. These observations suggest that the scholarship would benefit from broader engagement with the comparative literature on political economy and from a more precise and conceptually grounded definition of the “welfare state.”","political_science"
"Although struggles for reparations for slavery and its legacies date back to the earliest period of US politics, they have received relatively little attention from political scientists. Focusing on reparations claims, I argue, can enhance the study of Black social movements and political thought. The recent resurgence of demands for redress for racial injustice, both in the United States and internationally, and contemporary divisions over the politics of memory suggest why reparations are an important indicator of the prospects for multiracial democracy. Because the language of reparations has been used to advance a range of political ends, I conclude by considering some of the dilemmas that remain unresolved in the literature.","political_science"
"Most theoretical studies of coalition politics have focused on selection, rather than accountability: Coalition partners are selected according to the proximity of their positions in a Euclidean policy space. This proximity, together with institutional attributes of the party systems or the coalitions, serves also to explain the duration of the coalition. Empirical studies of retrospective voting, often with little connection to accountability theory, have generally concluded that the political survival of coalitions is considerably independent from elections. Such results, however, refer to governments as a whole. In this work, voters allocate rewards and punishments for past outcomes focusing on the prime ministers and their parties. If differences in clarity of responsibility exist, they do not seem to produce greater economic accountability of single-party governments—it is similarly limited under both coalition and single-party governments. Coalitions, however, increase the risks of losing office due to political crises, rather than elections. Prime ministers can respond to challenges by reshuffling the government or the coalition. Because such crises are launched under economic conditions that improve the welfare of citizens, coalitions may undermine democratic accountability.","political_science"
"Two theories predominate in discussions of why China and Vietnam have, over the past three decades, achieved such rapid economic growth. The first argues that their startling performance can be explained by economic factors associated with late industrialization. The second proposes that China and Vietnam represent novel models of political economic organization that need to be better studied and understood. In this essay we review the voluminous literature on the political economy of China and Vietnam, evaluating the critical debates over the economic benefits of decentralization, experimentation, and state-led development. Although the debate remains unsettled, analysis suggests that growth in the two countries was most robust during periods of state withdrawal from the economy and that current economic difficulties in both countries are now arising from the scale and character of the state's role in both economies.","political_science"
"This review proposes a comparative research agenda on center-right parties in advanced democracies, bringing together research in American and comparative politics. Political scientists have recently closely examined the decline of the center-left and the rise of the radical right but have paid less attention to the weakening of center-right parties. Yet cohesive center-right parties have facilitated political stability and compromises, while their disintegration has empowered radical challengers. After presenting an overview of right-wing politics in Western democracies and weighing different definitions of the electoral right, we discuss two factors that shape variations in center-right cohesion: organizational robustness of center-right partisan institutions and the (un)bundling of conservative mass attitudes on different policy dimensions. Last, we argue that a full account of the rise of the radical right cannot focus solely on the strategies of the center-left but must incorporate also the choices, opportunities, and constraints of center-right parties.","political_science"

"Political psychology in international relations (IR) has undergone a dramatic transformation in the past two decades, mirroring the broader changes occurring in IR itself. This review examines the current state of the field. We begin by offering a data-driven snapshot analyzing four years of manuscript classifications at a major IR journal to characterize the questions that IR scholars engaged in psychological research are and are not investigating. We then emphasize six developments in particular, both present-day growth areas (an increased interest in emotions and hot cognition, the rise of more psychologically informed work on public opinion, a nascent research tradition we call the first image reversed, and the rise of neurobiological and evolutionary approaches) and calls for additional scholarship (better integration of the study of mass and elite political behavior and more psychological work in international political economy). Together, these developments constitute some of the directions in which we see the next generation of scholarship heading.","political_science"
"Research on interest groups today neglects the important task of analyzing historical patterns and secular, long-term changes. We note critical measurement errors in how contemporary political science has assessed the origins and development of interest group politics in the United States. Interest group scholars lack the reliable longitudinal data available to such fields as electoral or congressional studies. We suggest multidimensional means of recovering the “lost years” of interest group research, compensating for the absence of comprehensive and systematic data on U.S. organized interests before the 1960s. In order to generate empirical and theoretical insights that are not constrained by a particular historical context, we propose a conceptual framework for studying “interest group systems” across time. We also examine the rich possibilities of investigating the interest group and party systems as interacting and autonomous vehicles of representation in American political development. Only by broadening the time horizons of research will scholars be able to develop reliable insights about patterns and transformations of American interest group politics.","political_science"
"This article reviews the burgeoning literature on democratic authoritarianism, which examines two related but distinct questions: why authoritarian regimes adopt institutions conventionally associated with democracy, and how these institutions strengthen authoritarian regimes and forestall democratization. The literature suggests that authoritarian regimes adopt and utilize nominally democratic institutions to augment their strength through five main mechanisms: signaling, information acquisition, patronage distribution, monitoring, and credible commitment. After evaluating each of these mechanisms, I discuss the empirical challenges facing this research agenda and suggest how the field should proceed to overcome these challenges.","political_science"
"Following closely the practice of peacekeeping, the literature on the subject has come in one small wave and then two larger ones. The first wave, during the Cold War, includes classic works focusing mainly on peacekeeping in wars between states. The second wave, at first inspired by the boom in peacekeeping shortly after the end of the Cold War, soon reflected disillusionment and focuses largely on failure and dysfunction, despite significant cases of success. The third and most recent wave also reflects a resurgence in peacekeeping but is newly concerned with systematic and methodologically rigorous analysis (both quantitative and qualitative) of basic empirical questions about the effects of peacekeeping and the sources of peacekeeping outcomes. Recent empirical studies have demonstrated peacekeeping's effectiveness in maintaining peace, but related questions persist concerning the use of force, transitional administrations, which organizations most effectively keep peace, perspectives of the “peacekept,” and effects on democratization.","political_science"
"The link between climate change and conflict has been discussed intensively in academic literature during the past decade. This review aims to provide a clearer picture of what the research community currently has to say with regard to this nexus. It finds that the literature has not detected a robust and general effect linking climate to conflict onset. Substantial agreement exists that climatic changes contribute to conflict under some conditions and through certain pathways. In particular, the literature shows that climatic conditions breed conflict in fertile grounds: in regions dependent on agriculture and in combination and interaction with other socioeconomic and political factors such as a low level of economic development and political marginalization. Future research should continue to investigate how climatic changes interact with and/or are conditioned by socioeconomic, political, and demographic settings to cause conflict and uncover the causal mechanisms that link these two phenomena.","political_science"
"There are reasons why some political ideas fit better into a theoretical framework than others. This article analyzes attempts to detheorize nationalism, arguing that they serve three major functions. First, they free nationalists from universalizing their arguments and from the ensuing rights and obligations. Second, they allow its rivals to present nationalism as morally inferior to other political standpoints. Third, they lead to the singling out and legitimization of one specific form of nationalism that is principle driven. Drawing a line between forms of nationalism—those motivated by primordial feelings and those motivated by rational and universal principles—lays the groundwork for a distinction between ethnic and civic nationalism. Though in theory these are two distinct forms of nationalism, in reality the boundaries are blurred. And yet advocates of civic nationalism keep the distinction alive, wishing to distance themselves from the other form of nationalism and promoting a vision (some would say the illusion) of a nationless nationalism. Assuming that Western democracies have transcended their national and ethnic elements encourages politicians to ignore social schisms, avoiding the need to cope with their consequences. The civic language therefore not only is theoretically inaccurate but also motivates avoidance where action is needed.","political_science"
"We review advances in the study of retrospective voting, or how citizens evaluate and act on their perceptions of government performance. As a whole, the recent literature provides a more complete and nuanced picture of the retrospective voter as sometimes, but not always, effectively incentivizing elected officials to enhance public welfare. Leveraging examples of retrospective voting in areas other than the economy, the field is heading toward a middle ground in which voters resemble decision makers in many other domains. In many cases, a coherent logic governs voters' choices. In other instances, voters make mistakes, often in predictable ways subject to well-known psychological biases. Understanding the circumstances under which retrospective voting achieves effective democratic accountability and when it fails to do so is an important task for subsequent research. We discuss two additional issues for future exploration: a better understanding of normative benchmarks, and increased attention to the relationship between retrospective voting behavior and policy outcomes.","political_science"
"Low levels of female labor force participation contribute to female underrepresentation in democratic polities, both by reinforcing traditional voter attitudes toward women (a demand-side feature) and by constraining the supply of women with professional experience and resources who are capable of mounting credible electoral campaigns. Female labor force participation, however, is only part of the story. Comparative analysis suggests that electoral systems have a strong, systematic effect on the extent to which women's workforce participation boosts female political representation. In candidate-centered political systems, where seniority is an important factor in legislative effectiveness, career interruptions for the sake of childcare and other family work hurts female aspiring politicians more seriously than in proportional representation (PR) systems, where political parties control the policy platform and constituency service is a minor consideration in the careers of candidates. In countries with mixed electoral systems, women do better in seats elected by PR than by single-member plurality. Within countries, women are more likely to get elected to offices characterized by shorter tenure and higher average levels of turnover.","political_science"
"The newest “new institutionalism,” discursive institutionalism, lends insight into the role of ideas and discourse in politics while providing a more dynamic approach to institutional change than the older three new institutionalisms. Ideas are the substantive content of discourse. They exist at three levels—policies, programs, and philosophies—and can be categorized into two types, cognitive and normative. Discourse is the interactive process of conveying ideas. It comes in two forms: the coordinative discourse among policy actors and the communicative discourse between political actors and the public. These forms differ in two formal institutional contexts; simple polities have a stronger communicative discourse and compound polities a stronger coordinative discourse. The institutions of discursive institutionalism, moreover, are not external-rule-following structures but rather are simultaneously structures and constructs internal to agents whose “background ideational abilities” within a given “meaning context” explain how institutions are created and exist and whose “foreground discursive abilities,” following a “logic of communication,” explain how institutions change or persist. Interests are subjective ideas, which, though real, are neither objective nor material. Norms are dynamic, intersubjective constructs rather than static structures.","political_science"
"Little attention has been paid to the social processes of civil war—the transformation of social actors, structures, norms, and practices—that sometimes leave enduring legacies for the postwar period. In this article, I explore the changes wrought by six social processes: political mobilization, military socialization, polarization of social identities, militarization of local authority, transformation of gender roles, and fragmentation of the local political economy. Some of these social processes occur in peacetime, but war may radically change their pace, direction, or consequences, with perhaps irreversible effects. I trace the wide variation in these processes during the wars in four countries: Peru, El Salvador, Sri Lanka, and Sierra Leone. I analyze the effects of these processes as transformations in social networks. These processes reconfigure social networks in a variety of ways, creating new networks, dissolving some, and changing the structure of others.","political_science"
"The topic of migration raises important and challenging normative questions about the legitimacy of state power, the boundaries of political membership, and justice within and across state borders. States exercise power over borders, but what, if anything, justifies this power? Is it morally permissible for liberal democratic states to prevent their citizens from exiting the country and exclude prospective migrants from entering? If liberal democratic states are justified in excluding some and accepting others, how should they decide whom to admit? This review examines how contemporary political theorists and philosophers have answered these questions. First, I examine the conventional view that says states have the right to control immigration; second, I discuss arguments for open borders. The third section examines critique of open borders, and the fourth section considers more recent arguments that have been advanced in favor of the conventional view. I conclude with some suggestions for future research.","political_science"
"This article reviews recent survey-based research on citizens’ trust in government, focusing particularly on the United States. It addresses the long-term decline in trust and potential causes for this decline, with an emphasis on the effects of partisanship, polarization, performance, process, and media priming. While dispositions can anchor trust levels, the dominant research findings show that the sources of variation and change in trust are political, if multifaceted, in nature. We discuss new versions of standard measures, call for a renewed look at the distinction between trust in authorities and trust in the regime, review ongoing work on how and why trust matters, and recommend broadening the foci of mistrust to include antiestablishment sentiments and attacks on electoral integrity. How trust intervenes between perceptions of political processes and compliance with authoritative commands is a critical domain for additional research. We conclude with a caveat against confidence that the decline in trust can be quickly or easily reversed.","political_science"
"This article reviews the remarkable growth in empirical literature in political science on wartime sexual violence against civilians, including rape, sexual slavery, forced marriage, and other forms. Early work, motivated by ongoing conflicts in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, tended to portray these forms of violence as inevitable, ubiquitous, and either opportunistic or strategic. However, recent literature and new data sources have documented substantial variation in sexual violence across countries, conflicts, perpetrators, and victims and survivors. Building on this observed variation, scholars have developed and tested a wealth of theories about when, where, why, and under what conditions sexual violence occurs as well as its consequences. We highlight the core findings from the literature, explain the key debates among experts, and explore several avenues for future research. We conclude by detailing what the study of wartime sexual violence—both the findings and the research process—offers to a broader set of political science scholars.","political_science"
"Early research on wartime violence against civilians highlighted a distinction between macro- and micro-level approaches. Macro-level approaches, grounded in the international relations subfield, focus on variation across countries or conflicts, while micro-level approaches, more influenced by the comparative politics subfield, focus on variation within countries or conflicts. However, some of the recent research on civilian targeting does not fit neatly into this dichotomy—such as research comparing subnational units or armed groups across conflicts or research relying on geo-referenced event data for multiple conflicts. We review the literature and advocate moving beyond the language of the micro- and macro-level divide, instead focusing on the determinants of violence against civilians at five different levels of analysis: international, domestic, subnational, organizational, and individual. While acknowledging significant advances in the field, we argue for continued research aimed at developing a more integrated theoretical understanding of the multiple actors and interactive social processes driving violence against civilians.","political_science"
"The initial optimism that greeted the onset of the “Third Wave” of democratization has cooled with the instability of many new democracies and the proliferation of stable competitive authoritarian regimes. These disappointments have produced a return to structural theories emphasizing the constraints posed by underdevelopment, resource endowments, inequality, and ethno-religious cleavages. We argue, however, for a sharper focus on the political mechanisms that link such factors to the emergence of democracy, including the extent of institutionalization in new democracies and the still understudied role of civil society and the capacity for collective action. The international dimensions of democratization also require closer analysis. We also underline a methodological point: The quest for an overarching theory of democracy and democratization may be misguided. Generalizations supported by cross-national statistical work yield numerous anomalies and indicate the need for approaches that emphasize combinations of causal factors, alternative pathways, and equifinality.","political_science"
"In many democratic polities, constitutional courts significantly shape the political landscape. Yet, how they are able to do so is a puzzle: With limited resources at their disposal, and no direct powers of enforcement, judges must rely on the willingness of executives and legislators to comply with their decisions and to respect judicial authority. This essay surveys recent literature that has explored the conditions that sustain judicial authority. I contrast explanations that highlight the benefits that independent courts can provide to other policy makers (“endogenous explanations”) with explanations that emphasize the constraints that keep executives and legislators from undermining the judiciary (“exogenous explanations”). I conclude by exploring the role of strategic judicial behavior in maintaining and expanding judicial power.","political_science"
"Political scientists are fielding more and more surveys in the developing world. Yet, most survey research methodology derives from experiences in developed countries. Researchers working in the developing world often confront very different challenges to collecting high-quality data. Census data may be unreliable or outdated, enumerators may shirk, political topics may be sensitive, and respondents may be unaccustomed to and uncomfortable with an interview format. In this article, we review both published methodological research and the best practices of scholars based on an original expert survey of survey researchers. We characterize the state of the field and provide insights about the range of available options for implementing surveys in the developing world. We examine and assess innovations across many aspects of survey implementation, including sampling, enumeration, data collection, ethical considerations, and reporting. We also offer suggestions for future methodological inquiry and for greater research transparency.","political_science"
"This article analyzes American democracy from a European perspective. It argues that American democracy (like European democracies) is based on antinomies, two societal and two institutional, deeply rooted in American constitutional development. Thus, each time American democracy has been used as a model and exported, the attempt has ended in failure. An antinomic model can be studied but not imitated. The article concludes that what is interesting for non-Americans is the way American democracy has historically dealt with these antinomies, more than the American model per se. The American method has to do with a peculiar constitutional structure that, having had the chance to institutionalize liberal principles, has tended to promote a positive-sum solution to those antinomies, in accord with individualistic values. Here resides the great divide between American and European constitutional structures; for opposite reasons, the European constitutional structure tends to promote a zero-sum solution to similar antinomies, in agreement with collectivistic values. In both structures, something important may be lost—private freedom in the latter and public good in the former. Could a reciprocal constitutional learning process allow both sides to learn the missing side of the story?","political_science"
"Many social scientists rely on the rule of law in their accounts of political or economic development. Many, however, simply equate law with a stable government capable of enforcing the rules generated by a political authority. As two decades of largely failed efforts to build the rule of law in poor and transition countries and continuing struggles to build international legal order demonstrate, we still do not understand how legal order is produced, especially in places where it does not already exist. We here canvas literature in the social sciences to identify the themes and gaps in the existing accounts. We conclude that this literature has failed to produce a microfoundational account of the phenomenon of legal order. We then discuss our recent effort to develop the missing microfoundations of legal order to provide a better framework for future work on the rule of law.","political_science"
"This article assesses the utility of selectorate theory as a tool for understanding authoritarian politics. We start by discussing the intellectual history of the selectorate concept and its original usage in the authoritarian context. We then turn our focus to the selectorate theory as developed in The Logic of Political Survival (LPS) ( Bueno de Mesquita et al. 2003 ), identifying three problematic aspects of the theory and its application to authoritarian politics. First, the utility of the theory's key concepts of the selectorate and winning coalition is questionable in authoritarian systems where formal institutions to structure political transitions are absent or inconsequential. Second, measurement of the sizes of the selectorate and winning coalition is flawed, calling into question the empirical findings in LPS, such as its central claims about the survival of rulers. Third, the assumptions in the LPS version of the theory are restrictive in ways that reduce the utility of the selectorate concept relative to earlier works. We conclude that selectorate theory is a blunt instrument for understanding authoritarian rule.","political_science"
"The East Asian economic crisis of 1997–1999 had its causes not mainly in the “East Asian model” nor even in departures from the model, but in international capital markets and the governments of the core economies, especially the United States and Japan. The post–Bretton Woods system, without any link between the dollar and gold, allowed the United States to finance persistent external deficits by creating US government bonds. These bonds raised the foreign reserves of the surplus countries, notably Japan and East Asia. The rise in reserves triggered credit booms that generated asset inflation and industrial overcapacity. The booms gave way to crisis. The East Asian variant differed from the earlier Japanese one by being fueled by very large capital inflows in the early to mid 1990s from recession-hit Japan and Europe, as well as from the United States. This perspective, which highlights causes outside of East Asia, suggests that emerging market economies will remain vulnerable to such crises in the absence of capital controls, a different system of international payments, and a more equal world income distribution. It also suggests unexpected directions for political science research.  To its credit [Korea] has acknowledged its faults with remarkable candour. It has not tried to blame foreigners for its troubles, nor has it hid behind tariff barriers or currency controls. Instead, it has pledged to abandon the economic system that took it from poverty to prosperity in a generation. ( Economist 1999 )  The Korean economy is another kind of leftover Cold War artifact, good for an era of security threats and close bilateral relations with Washington but of questionable use in the global “world without borders” of the 1990s…. It is a highly leveraged, highly political, manifestly corrupt nexus between the state and big business…. [It] has always been intrinsically unstable and therefore vulnerable to exactly the sort of financial calamity that has now befallen it. ( Woo-Cumings 1997 )","political_science"
"Are democratization and economic reform in tension with each other, or are they mutually supportive processes? A survey of new democracies in Latin America, Southern Europe, and the postsocialist world suggests that the answer varies by region. In the postsocialist cases, the relationship is positive and robust; in the other two regions, the relationship is negligible. Region, however, cannot serve as the explanation. Instead, what emerge as critical—and what happen to vary by region—are three factors that shape the relationship between democratization and economic reform: the timing of democratization, the agenda of transformation, and variations in governing mandates.","political_science"
"Transnational actors and transnational governance now form core elements of global environmental politics alongside intergovernmental diplomacy and institutions. This article explores how and under what conditions this transnationalism has arisen, as well as its implications for world politics. It considers what effects transnational actors and governance have had on political outcomes, their relation to states and intergovernmental institutions, and normative questions around their legitimacy and accountability. The critical role of transnational actors and institutions in environmental politics has made the field a laboratory for broader questions concerning the evolution of global governance in world politics more generally. As global environmental challenges continue to magnify and affect other spheres of political activity, understanding these dynamics will become increasingly important.","political_science"
"This review examines the role of race in the decennial process of redistricting. I review the scholarly literature on three related questions: What role should racial redistricting play in the representation of racial interests, how may racial redistricting be used, and what is the connection between racial redistricting and the substantive representation of racial minorities? The review briefly examines the normative question of racial representation and then focuses on the last two topics: empirical research on how racial interests are represented in legislatures and legal questions concerning the use of redistricting to produce descriptive representation. Racial redistricting enhances the representation of racial interests in legislatures, and the legal status of the districts is complex; therefore, litigation will proceed on a heavily fact-based, case-by-case basis in which political scientists will continue to play a vital role with their research on racially polarized voting and representation.","political_science"
"Political scientists use diverse methods to study important topics. The findings they reach and conclusions they draw can have significant social implications and are sometimes controversial. As a result, audiences can be skeptical about the rigor and relevance of the knowledge claims that political scientists produce. For these reasons, being a political scientist means facing myriad questions about how we know what we claim to know. Transparency can help political scientists address these questions. An emerging literature and set of practices suggest that sharing more data and providing more information about our analytic and interpretive choices can help others understand the rigor and relevance of our claims. At the same time, increasing transparency can be costly and has been contentious. This review describes opportunities created by, and difficulties posed by, attempts to increase transparency. We conclude that, despite the challenges, consensus about the value and practice of transparency is emerging within and across political science's diverse and dynamic research communities.","political_science"
"In notable ways, analysis of the Black Power Movement (BPM) by political scientists has been woefully neglected in comparison to analyses proffered by historians, sociologists, and Black Studies scholars. This comparative neglect is partly owed to political science's reticence to meaningfully engage the ideological locus of the BPM, black nationalism, through rigorous theoretical or methodological analysis. In this review, I highlight some of the major contributions of political scientists to the analysis of the BPM while exploring some of the challenges and opportunities for further study and examination of this singular period in US and international politics.","political_science"
"Military rule as a form of autocratic governance can mean either rule by a military strongman unconstrained by other officers or rule by a group of high-ranking officers who can limit the dictator's discretion. We label the latter form a military regime. Both military strongmen and military regimes are more likely to commit human rights abuses and become embroiled in civil wars than are civilian dictatorships. The behavior of strongmen diverges from that of more constrained military rulers in other areas, however. Military strongmen start more international wars than either military regimes or civilian dictators, perhaps because they have more reason to fear postouster exile, prison, or assassination. Fear of the future may also motivate their resistance to transition. Military strongmen are more often ousted by insurgency, popular uprising, or invasion than are military regimes or civilian dictators. Their tenures rarely end in democratization, whereas the opposite is true of military regimes.","political_science"
"The examination of feminist research on political representation, public policy, and political institutions indicates that a shift in emphasis from the dichotomous variable of sex to the concept of gender is taking place. The shift is incomplete partly because many feminists believe both concepts are necessary to good research design. While mainstream political scientists have become more willing to use sex as a background variable in their research, they have not come to terms with notions of gender, a reluctance that may cause them to make important mistakes in their analysis of politics. Gender is a concept that suggests another major reexamination of what we think about political life. Its implications are insistent and far-reaching, offering a productive means of understanding politics.","political_science"
"This article reviews recent contributions addressing the following questions: Under what circumstances is monetary policy delegated to politically independent central banks? What effects do these politically independent institutions have, and how do they interact with their macroeconomic institutional environment? What explains the variation in their behavior? And finally, to what extent has the recent economic crisis altered the role of these institutions? In answering these questions, this article advances two arguments. First, even though central banks' activities involve a great deal of technical knowledge, they are unavoidably political institutions: They make distributional choices informed by ideas, preferences, and the political context in which they operate. Second, the economic crisis, by expanding the type of activities that monetary authorities undertake, further contributes to the politicization of these institutions. The final section of the article speculates about the implications of these developments for economic policy making in contemporary democracies.","political_science"
"Text has always been an important data source in political science. What has changed in recent years is the feasibility of investigating large amounts of text quantitatively. The internet provides political scientists with more data than their mentors could have imagined, and the research community is providing accessible text analysis software packages, along with training and support. As a result, text-as-data research is becoming mainstream in political science. Scholars are tapping new data sources, they are employing more diverse methods, and they are becoming critical consumers of findings based on those methods. In this article, we first describe the four stages of a typical text-as-data project. We then review recent political science applications and explore one important methodological challenge—topic model instability—in greater detail.","political_science"
"American exceptionalism is the oldest and most contentious of the alleged national exceptionalisms—arguments that a given nation must be understood in essentially idiosyncratic fashion. John Winthrop, Alexis de Tocqueville, and Karl Marx helped develop and sustain an American variant for the first 350 years of a separate American political life. Modern political scientists have addressed the notion in a more systematic and methodologically self-conscious manner during the past half century. Nevertheless, much of the argument revolves around conceptual issues, operational difficulties, and empirical traps, so that these must provide the contours of the subject here. Two major recent books with sharply divergent conclusions, both marshaling extensive empirical evidence, serve not only as a means of updating the classical argument and of presenting its modern opposition. Both also suggest—indeed, contribute—further reasons for the continuing lure of a difficult and divisive notion.","political_science"
"As globalization has opened up channels of communication between different countries and increased interest in cross-national analysis, public opinion survey research has expanded its reach in the world. This article examines both the breadth and the depth of the globalization of public opinion research. First, we discuss the growth of cross-national surveys such as the World Values Survey, the International Social Survey Program, the European Social Survey, and the various Global Barometers. We then turn to the issues of data quality and comparability. Has the globalization of survey research meant the spread of a standard “product” of known and equivalent quality to diverse countries? Can survey research in diverse countries and contexts deliver meaningful comparisons of public opinion? Has globalization led to the dominance of an intellectual framework and set of assumptions that may not be quite appropriate outside their original homes? Finally, the article suggests a new standard for “grading” cross-national programs of survey research, inspired by debates in evidence-based medicine.","political_science"
"In this essay, I review recent research on the effects of economic development on democracy. On the theoretical side, for the first time there has been a systematic attempt to bring the types of formal models developed by economists and political scientists outside of comparative politics to bear on the origins of democracy. I present a simple analytical framework that captures some of the results in this literature. On the empirical side, the issue of identifying causal relationships in the data is finally receiving attention. However, the application of techniques adopted from best-practice econometrics shows no evidence that economic development has a causal effect on democracy. Neither does it support the idea that economic development influences the probability of coups but not democratizations. More likely, and in line with the model I develop, income per capita and democracy are correlated because the same features of a society simultaneously determine how prosperous and how democratic it is. There is still a lot to learn on this topic.","political_science"
"The last 20 years have witnessed an impressive outpouring of comparative politics research examining urban politics in the developing world. This research advances our understanding of phenomena such as clientelism, law and order, and local public goods provision. Scholarship could be strengthened, however, through more careful attention to how the urban setting of this research affects the politics examined. This article proposes two distinct ways in which urban politics can be conceptualized: politics taking place in urban agglomerations, characterized by large, diverse populations settled at high densities; or politics taking place within the boundaries of city jurisdictions, possessing legal powers and responsibilities distinct from those at other tiers of government or in rural areas. Adopting either of these conceptualizations illuminates new avenues for empirical work, theoretical innovation, and improved measurement. This article also shows that recent scholarship has neglected important, and fundamentally political, topics such as urban political economy, land markets, and environmental harms. Engaging with these areas would allow political scientists to revisit classic questions regarding the institutional influences on economic growth, the politics of redistribution, and the determinants of collective action.","political_science"
"A central claim of democratic theory is that democracy induces governments to be responsive to the preferences of the people. Political parties organize politics in every modern democracy, and some observers claim that parties are what induce democracies to be responsive. Yet, according to others, parties give voice to extremists and reduce the responsiveness of governments to the citizenry. The debate about parties and democracy takes on renewed importance as new democracies around the globe struggle with issues of representation and governability. I show that our view of the impact of parties on democratic responsiveness hinges on what parties are—their objectives and organization. I review competing theories of parties, sketch their testable implications, and note the empirical findings that may help adjudicate among these theories. I also review debates about the origins of parties, about the determinants of party-system size and characteristics, and about party competition.","political_science"
"Individuals, including researchers, often have to form beliefs about the political world from nonrepresentative samples—e.g., their friends, what they see on TV, or content on social media. Substantial evidence indicates that many struggle to account for this selection problem and generally form beliefs as if what they observe is representative. In this review, we provide a formal typology of how this phenomenon of selection neglect affects political beliefs. We identify three types of selection neglect: homophily leads individuals to believe others’ traits and beliefs are closer to their own; the squeaky wheel effect biases beliefs toward more visible or vocal groups; and the man bites dog effect leads to excessive belief in extreme or unusual events. Selection neglect is a unifying way to understand disparate literatures on perceptions of the economy and demographics, beliefs about others’ beliefs, partisan media, and social media. Much empirical research is consistent with biased beliefs driven by selection neglect but rarely directly tests this mechanism outside of lab settings. We discuss how future research can provide more direct evidence.","political_science"
"Little controversy remains about how the United States has changed demographically since the mid-1960s. Far more controversial is whether this change is bringing about a new politics of race. This article argues that a key to settling this debate is a clearer specification of the identity-to-politics link—the nexus from a population defined by shared racial and ethnic labels to a collective group politics based on those definitions. The article articulates some potential pitfalls in how this nexus is commonly specified in empirical research. It then proposes that researchers should be mindful of five processes that are typically lumped together in linking shared demographic categories to common political destinies: definition, identification, consciousness, venue selection, and choice. The article concludes with a discussion of the potential utility and limitations of unpacking these five processes in our analysis of the identity-to-politics link.","political_science"
"In political science, one issue still in need of greater theorizing is the proper measurement of bureaucratic autonomy, that is, the degree of discretion that political principals should grant to bureaucratic agents. This article reviews the literature on bureaucratic autonomy both in US administrative law and in political science. It uses the American experience to define five mechanisms by which political principals grant and limit autonomy, then goes on to survey the comparative literature on other democratic systems using the American framework as a baseline. Other democracies use different mixtures of these mechanisms, for example by substituting stronger ex post review for ex ante procedures or using appointment and removal power in place of either. We find that the administrative law and social science literatures on this topic approach it very differently, and that each would profit from greater awareness of the other discipline.","political_science"
"This article reviews the political science literature on political violence against civilians, including genocide, mass killing, and terrorism. Early work on these subjects tended to portray this kind of violence as irrational, random, or the result of ancient hatreds between ethnic groups. Most scholars studying political violence today, however, understand it to be primarily, if not exclusively, instrumental and orchestrated by powerful actors seeking to achieve tangible political or military objectives. Scholars continue to disagree, however, about the specific motives that drive belligerents to target civilians or the conditions under which large-scale violence against civilians is most likely.","political_science"
"Despite the increasing popularity of comparative work on other-regarding preferences, the implications of different models of altruism are not always fully understood. This article analyzes different theoretical approaches to altruism and explores what empirical conclusions we should draw from them, paying particular attention to models of redistribution preferences where inequality explicitly triggers other-regarding motives for redistribution. While the main contribution of this article is to clarify the conclusions of these models, we also illustrate the importance of their distinct implications by analyzing Western European data to compare among them. We draw on individual-level data from the European Social Survey fielded between September 2002 and December 2013.","political_science"
"This review examines empirical research about American national identity. It focuses on the social and political causes and consequences of (a) how people define what being American means and (b) their degree of attachment to being American. It explains why scholars increasingly view American identity as a social identity and reviews arguments for why political scientists should investigate American identity as both an independent and a dependent variable. Existing research documents a high degree of consensus across demographic groups regarding how American identity is defined. It also reveals both beneficial and harmful consequences of people strongly identifying as American. Empirical inquiries of American identity are motivated by demographic trends, especially the rise in immigration-driven diversity, but they are also deeply grounded in historical and philosophical assessments of the nature of American identity, and such scholarship is also discussed throughout the review.","political_science"
"Contrary to stylized accounts of policy making in democracies, it is routine for presidents, governors, and other chief executives to issue directives such as decrees and executive orders to make law on their own. This article evaluates what political scientists have learned about presidential unilateral power. In our view, while a quarter century of scholarship on the topic has yielded a variety of theoretical predictions, the empirical record offers conflicting and perhaps unreliable evidence to substantiate and adjudicate between them. We review the dominant theoretical perspectives, which focus largely on constraints related to the separation of powers and political accountability. We then evaluate the evidence supporting these arguments and conclude with recommendations for conceptual, theoretical, and empirical advancement.","political_science"
"Collaborations between the academy and governments promise to improve the lives of people, the operations of government, and our understanding of human behavior and public policy. This review shows that the evidence-informed policy movement consists of two main threads: ( a) an effort to invent new policies using insights from the social and behavioral science consensus about human behavior and institutions and ( b) an effort to evaluate the success of governmental policies using transparent and high-integrity research designs such as randomized controlled trials. We argue that the problems of each approach may be solved or at least well addressed by teams that combine the two. We also suggest that governmental actors ought to want to learn about why a new policy works as much as they want to know that the policy works. We envision a future evidence-informed public policy practice that ( a) involves cross-sector collaborations using the latest theory plus deep contextual knowledge to design new policies, ( b) applies the latest insights in research design and statistical inference for causal questions, and ( c) is focused on assessing explanations as much as on discovering what works. The evidence-informed public policy movement is a way that new data, new questions, and new collaborators can help political scientists improve our theoretical understanding of politics and also help our policy partners to improve the practice of government itself.","political_science"
"Social capital has not merely risen as a social scientific term in the scholarly literature; it has become routinized into everyday conversation and policy discourse across an extraordinarily diverse set of disciplines and substantive domains in countries around the world. It currently enjoys citation counts some 100 times larger than it did just 20 years ago and its popularity continues apace, despite numerous trenchant criticisms. Some of the reasons for the rise and routinization of social capital are explored, especially as they pertain to issues of primary concern to political science, namely collective action, economic development, and democratic governance (issues made especially salient by Putnam 1993 ). While ongoing debate is to be welcomed and rigor from individual scholars required, social capital must continue to do double duty: providing for diverse audiences a simple and intuitively appealing way of highlighting the intrinsic and instrumental importance of social relationships, while also yielding at the appropriate time to more precise terms appropriate for particular specialist audiences. Social capital is another “essentially contested concept” ( Gallie 1956 ) whose utility to social science (and beyond) rests less on its capacity to forge an inherently elusive scholarly or policy consensus on complex issues than its capacity to facilitate constructive dialogue about agreements and disagreements between groups who would otherwise rarely (if ever) interact.","political_science"
"We survey modern models of delegation that assume a boss and a subordinate pursue their own goals. Among the major themes covered are the following: the conditions under which the boss will prefer to delegate versus those in which she will prefer to retain authority; how a boss can induce a subordinate to truthfully reveal information; when rational principals will use the ally principle (i.e. delegate to agents with similar goals); delegation in repeated interactions; and how delegation can overcome commitment problems. These themes are relevant to a wide variety of institutions, affecting intralegislative organization, executive-legislative relations, and central banks.","political_science"
"The growing use of institutional analysis in the study of the European Union (EU) has improved EU scholarship and rendered it more integral to the discipline of political science. Institutionalist analyses differ regarding the theoretical role of institutions and actor preferences. We classify institutionalist approaches to the EU by their theoretical treatment (exogenous or endogenous) of institutions and preferences. Analyses at the research frontier transcend these categories and offer the promise of an improved understanding of EU politics and a greater contribution by EU studies to the broader discipline of political science.","political_science"
"Republican political theory has undergone a recent revival, first and most strongly among historians, subsequently in a more limited way among lawyers, philosophers, and political scientists. Surveying the many contexts in which republican principles are invoked, I find that appeals to republicanism are often redundant (there being other, probably better, ways of arguing for the same practices and outcomes) and sometimes unfortunate (setting off, among “street-level republicans,” resonances with darker features of the older republican tradition that contemporary academic theorists of republicanism would prefer to forget). Even the more attractive features of the republican ideal—deliberative engagement in pursuit of the common good—can invite communitarian excesses, and even the “liberal republican” versions that strive to avoid that outcome are largely bereft of mechanisms for realizing their vision.","political_science"
"The redistricting process evokes major questions about representative democracy, fairness, and political accountability. This article covers the state of the field along three dimensions. First, it explains how redistricting bears on questions about racial and minority representation. Second, it examines how redistricting influences electoral competition, focusing on the alleged power of partisans and incumbents to draw maps that eliminate all but token opposition. Third and last, it discusses the issues surrounding the redistricting process itself and how various procedural reforms may influence political outcomes. Although significant progress has been made in understanding how different redistricting schemes create various biases in the electoral system, a review of the literature shows that major questions have not been resolved regarding the effects of redistricting on electoral competition, partisan polarization, and representation of communities of interest, especially minorities. Moreover, there is insufficient evidence from empirical research to justify any particular reform of the redistricting process. In addition to filling these gaps, future work might also broaden the scope of research to assess how redistricting affects other aspects of democracy, including political participation, efficacy, and trust.","political_science"
"Electoral coordination occurs at two main levels: (a) within individual electoral districts, where competitors coordinate entry and citizens coordinate votes; and (b) across districts, as competitors from different districts ally to form regional or national parties. We know a fair amount about district-level electoral coordination for single-tier electoral systems. In particular, when political actors are primarily concerned with the current election and have good information about the relative chances of potential competitors, two different M + 1 rules apply in an M-seat district. First, the number of competitors entering a given race tends to be no more than M + 1; second, when more than M + 1 competitors do enter a race, votes tend to concentrate on at most M + 1 of them. We know much less about cross-district coordination, in which potentially separate local party systems merge to form a national party system. This essay focuses on the latter, relatively neglected topic.","political_science"
"The tension between law and politics places transitional justice under cross-pressures. The impetus to hold perpetrators legally accountable for atrocities and major rights violations has emerged in part from the expectation that subjecting political behavior to the apolitical judgment of law will exert a civilizing effect. As demands for accountability have risen, politics has played a central role at every step. The past decade has seen a flourishing of research in empirical political science on the relationship between law and politics in postconflict and postauthoritarian justice. This research has tried to explain the turn to individual legal accountability and the development of norms and institutions for accountability. Research has stressed the role of politics in shaping the implementation of trials and other modes of accountability. It has also examined the consequences of these modes of accountability. We address research on each of these topics.","political_science"
"We inventory more than 150 studies of distributive politics in more than three dozen countries other than the United States. We organize existing studies under two theories: theories of democratic accountability and theories of government responsiveness. Studies that concern democratic accountability conceptualize distributive allocations as attempts by politicians to protect themselves electorally by targeting specific groups of voters. We identify four subsets: (a) studies of whether politicians target goods to core or swing voters; (b) studies of general political favoritism in targeting government goods; (c) studies of whether goods are disbursed according to the electoral cycle; and (d) studies of whether elected officials gain votes from the disbursement of government goods. We illustrate each with examples from the literature. We then discuss distributive politics as responsiveness to the median voter. This perspective entails a focus on the redistributive consequences of government policy and investigates whether special interests capture a disproportionate share of goods coming from government. To illustrate the utility of both perspectives, we analyze original data on electricity provision in India's largest state.","political_science"
"In the environmental literature, accounts of cooperative progress commonly emphasize the activity and leadership of nongovernmental organizations, as well as the constitutive roles that environmental regimes play by legitimizing, by promoting reflectivist discourse, and by redefining roles. This essay lays out the differences between the constructivist and political-economic theories of environmental regime effectiveness and examines the extent to which the constructivist emphasis is empirically justified by three recent collections of case studies. Of the surprisingly modest effects that environmental regimes have had, most appear to have come through the use of mechanisms that already play a prominent role in the political economy literature. Constructivist processes, despite the attention they have received, appear to have had only a marginal impact.","political_science"
"Debates over the development and density of housing have gained visibility in recent years as housing costs have skyrocketed in many metropolitan areas. With those who seek to limit development (NIMBYs) on one side and those who seek to promote it (YIMBYs) on the other, scholarly attention has turned to understanding preferences and power in the politics of development. This article reviews scholarship relating to the politics of land use. After discussing the history of land use regulation, we describe who the important actors are (and, generally, what they want) in the politics of land use; we explain the distribution of power and inequality in the politics of land use; and we briefly review how land use regulation affects other societal outcomes. We end with a set of unanswered political questions that could push the field forward.","political_science"
"The second half of the twentieth century and the beginning of the twenty-first century have witnessed an unprecedented expansion of one-party autocracies. One-party regimes have become the most common type of authoritarian rule and have proved to be more stable and to grow faster than other types of authoritarianism. We review the literature on one-party rule and, using data from 1950–2006, suggest four avenues for future research: focusing on autocrats' ability to simultaneously minimize threats from the elites and from the masses; focusing on the conditions that foster the establishment and the collapse of one- party regimes and on transitions from one type of authoritarianism to another; focusing on the relationship between authoritarian elections and democratization; and focusing on the global and international forces that influence the spread of one-party rule.","political_science"

"Two leaders engaged in international co-operation must each build trust by credibly signalling that they will not exploit the other by defecting at the implementation stage. Previous research does not reveal the difficulty and cost of such international reassurance. The role that costly adjustments by markets play in international reassurance is analysed, showing that fully efficient information revelation can be achieved when market actors under intense competitive pressures undergo sufficiently costly adjustments in expectation of international co-operation. ‘Nice’ leaders can reveal their true preferences simply by saying they intend to co-operate, because ‘mean’ leaders are unwilling to mislead market actors into undergoing futile costly adjustments. However, market imperfections prevent full information revelation unless market actors prefer international co-operation to the status quo.","political_science"
"Traditionally, and for some good reasons, elections in Communist one-party states have been treated as relatively unimportant phenomena, essentially ‘massive demonstrations of ritualized affirmation’, or simply a test of the Communist party's mobilization powers. The absence of competing political parties and consequently opposing goals and programmes does clearly mean that such elections are very different from those in liberal democratic states. They do not and cannot, for example, resolve the often crucial question of political succession.","political_science"
"This article is a contribution to the debate between ‘empirical’ and ‘classical’ theories of democracy. It draws attention to a hitherto neglected aspect of that debate, namely the historical process by which a word like ‘democracy’ gains its commendatory overtones. To call a state a democracy was not always to praise it; the argument here is that an understanding of how this came about can clarify some of the issues involved in considering whether or not states are properly to be called democracies. Although the methods used derive from linguistic philosophy, the purpose is to direct attention towards the values and aspirations of historical agents using the term, rather than to a purely conceptual analysis of it.","political_science"
"Two main themes have been emphasized in recent description and interpretation of English political behaviour. One theme traces the stability of our political system to a widespread attachment to the civic values of submission to authority and an intermittent popular participation. The other theme explains support (at least among the manual working class) for the Conservative party in terms of deference to a traditional elite and/or a pragmatic appraisal of that party's economic and welfare capabilities. Little attention has been paid to the validity of either interpretation or to the relations between them. Accordingly, this paper first reviews the evidence for both themes and attempts to relate them, and then introduces some new survey data to throwfurther light on this problematic subject.","political_science"
"China's politics have changed dramatically during the last decade. Schram, in one of the works which have stimulated this review article, has characterized the period since 1978 as one of ‘Economics in Command’ by way of contrast to the exhortation to put ‘Politics in Command’ – the slogan that dominated the last decade of Mao's life and the era of the Cultural Revolution. The drive to economic modernization has replaced ‘class struggle’ as the main goal of the People's Republic of China (PRC). Political reform has been an essential part of that drive, for in its analysis of the failings of the previous three decades the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has argued that economic growth and development could not occur without political stability and institutionalization.","political_science"
"This paper is based upon data collected in a survey of public attitudes toward the energy crisis, and toward U.S. energy policies, in several California communities in mid-1975. The authors believe that some of the information obtained in this survey makes possible a significant, though by no means conclusive and exhaustive, comparison of two models of civic ‘affect’. Following the usage of Almond and Verba, we take ‘affect’ to be ‘feelings about the political system, its roles, personnel, and performance’.","political_science"
"After collective traumas such as natural disasters and terrorist attacks, members of concerned communities experience intense emotions and talk profusely about them. Although these exchanges resemble simple emotional venting, Durkheim’s theory of collective effervescence postulates that these collective emotions lead to higher levels of solidarity in the affected community. We present the first large-scale test of this theory through the analysis of digital traces of 62,114 Twitter users after the Paris terrorist attacks of November 2015. We found a collective negative emotional response followed by a marked long-term increase in the use of lexical indicators related to solidarity. Expressions of social processes, prosocial behavior, and positive affect were higher in the months after the attacks for the individuals who participated to a higher degree in the collective emotion. Our findings support the conclusion that collective emotions after a disaster are associated with higher solidarity, revealing the social resilience of a community.","psychology"
"Recent experiences influence the processing of new information even when those experiences are irrelevant to the current task. Does this reflect the indirect effects of a passively maintained representation of the previous experience, or is this representation reactivated when a new event occurs? To answer this question, we attempted to decode the orientation of the stimulus on the previous trial from the electroencephalogram on the current trial in a working memory task. Behavioral data confirmed that the previous-trial stimulus orientation influenced the reported orientation on the current trial, even though the previous-trial orientation was now task irrelevant. In two independent experiments, we found that the previous-trial orientation could be decoded from the current-trial electroencephalogram, indicating that the current-trial stimulus reactivated or boosted the representation of the previous-trial orientation. These results suggest that the effects of recent experiences on behavior are driven, in part, by a reactivation of those experiences and not solely by the indirect effects of passive memory traces.","psychology"
"The persistent threat of natural disasters and their attendant resource shocks has likely shaped our prosocial drives throughout human evolution. However, it remains unclear how specific experiences during these events might impact cooperative decision making. We conducted two waves of four modified dictator-game experiments with the same individuals in Vanuatu ( N = 164), before and after Cyclone Pam in 2015. After the cyclone, participants were generally less likely to show prosocial motives toward both in-group and out-group members and more likely to show parochialism when sharing between groups. Experiencing greater property damage predicted a general decrease in prosocial allocations and preference for participants’ in-group. By contrast, exposure to other people in distress predicted increased prosocial allocations to both participants’ in-group and out-groups. Our results suggest that people adjust their prosocial behavior in response to natural disasters but that the nature and direction of the effect depend on the type and severity of their experiences.","psychology"
"Examining how informal knowledge systems change after formal instruction is imperative to understanding learning processes and conceptual development and to implementing effective educational practices. We used network analyses to determine how the organization of informal knowledge about multidigit numbers in kindergartners ( N = 279; mean age = 5.76 years, SD = 0.55; 135 females) supports and is transformed by a year of in-school formal instruction. The results show that in kindergarten, piecemeal knowledge about the surface properties of reading and writing multidigit numbers and the use of base-10 units to determine large quantities are strongly associated with each other and connected in a stringlike manner to other emerging skills. After a year of instruction, each skill becomes connected to the “hub” abilities of reading and writing multidigit numbers, which also become strongly connected to more advanced knowledge of base-10 principles. These findings provide new insights into how partial knowledge provides the backbone on which explicit principles are learned.","psychology"
"Here, we report novel empirical results from a psychophysical experiment in which we tested the echolocation abilities of nine blind adult human experts in click-based echolocation. We found that they had better acuity in localizing a target and used lower intensity emissions (i.e., mouth clicks) when a target was placed 45° off to the side compared with when it was placed at 0° (straight ahead). We provide a possible explanation of the behavioral result in terms of binaural-intensity signals, which appear to change more rapidly around 45°. The finding that echolocators have better echo-localization off axis is surprising, because for human source localization (i.e., regular spatial hearing), it is well known that performance is best when targets are straight ahead (0°) and decreases as targets move farther to the side. This may suggest that human echolocation and source hearing rely on different acoustic cues and that human spatial hearing has more facets than previously thought.","psychology"
"Mind wandering is a state in which our mental focus shifts toward task-unrelated thoughts. Although it is known that mind wandering has a detrimental effect on concurrent task performance (e.g., decreased accuracy), its effect on executive functions is poorly studied. Yet the latter question is relevant to many real-world situations, such as rapid stopping during driving. Here, we studied how mind wandering would affect the requirement to subsequently stop an incipient motor response. In healthy adults, we tested whether mind wandering affected stopping and, if so, which component of stopping was affected: the triggering of the inhibitory brake or the implementation of the brake following triggering. We observed that during mind wandering, stopping latency increased, as did the percentage of trials with failed triggering. Indeed, 67% of the variance of the increase in stopping latency was explained by increased trigger failures. Thus, mind wandering primarily affects stopping by affecting the triggering of the brake.","psychology"
"According to the social-investment principle, entering new environments is associated with new social roles that influence people’s behaviors. In this study, we examined whether young adults’ personality development is differentially related to their choice of either an academic or a vocational pathway (i.e., entering an academic-track school or beginning vocational training). The personality constructs of interest were Big Five personality traits and vocational-interest orientations. We used a longitudinal study design and propensity-score matching to create comparable groups before they entered one of the pathways and then tested the differences between these groups 6 years later. We expected the vocational pathway to reinforce more mature behavior and curtail investigative interest. Results indicated that choosing the vocational compared with the academic pathway was associated with higher conscientiousness and less interest in investigative, social, and enterprising activities.","psychology"
"When we receive information in the presence of other people, are we sensitive to what they do or do not understand? In two event-related-potential experiments, participants read implausible sentences (e.g., “The girl had a little beak”) in contexts that rendered them plausible (e.g., “The girl dressed up as a canary for Halloween”). No semantic-processing difficulty (no N400 effect) ensued when they read the sentences while alone in the room. However, when a confederate was present who did not receive the contexts so that the critical sentences were implausible for him or her, participants exhibited processing difficulty: the social-N400 effect. This effect was obtained when participants were instructed to adopt the confederate’s perspective—and critically, even without such instructions—but not when performing a demanding comprehension task. Thus, unless mental resources are limited, comprehenders engage in modeling the minds not only of those individuals with whom they directly interact but also of those individuals who are merely present during the linguistic exchange.","psychology"
"When two individuals from different social groups exhibit identical behavior, egalitarian codes of conduct call for equal judgments of both individuals. However, this moral imperative is at odds with the statistical imperative to consider priors based on group membership. Insofar as these priors differ, Bayesian rationality calls for unequal judgments of both individuals. We show that participants criticized the morality and intellect of someone else who made a Bayesian judgment, shared less money with this person, and incurred financial costs to punish this person. However, participants made unequal judgments as a Bayesian statistician would, thereby rendering the same judgment that they found repugnant when offered by someone else. This inconsistency, which can be reconciled by differences in which base rate is attended to, suggests that participants use group membership in a way that reflects the savvy of a Bayesian and the disrepute of someone they consider to be a bigot.","psychology"
"Six-month-old infants can store representations of multiple objects in working memory but do not always remember the objects’ features (e.g., shape). Here, we asked whether infants’ object representations (a) may contain conceptual content and (b) may contain this content even if perceptual features are forgotten. We hid two conceptually distinct objects (a humanlike doll and a nonhuman ball) one at a time in two separate locations and then tested infants’ memory for the first-hidden object by revealing either the original hidden object or an unexpected other object. Using looking time, we found that infants remembered the categorical identity of the hidden object but failed to remember its perceptual identity. Our results suggest that young infants may encode conceptual category in a representation of an occluded object, even when perceptual features are lost.","psychology"
"A major challenge for visual recognition is to describe shapes flexibly enough to allow generalization over different views. Computer vision models have championed a potential solution in medial-axis shape skeletons—hierarchically arranged geometric structures that are robust to deformations like bending and stretching. In the experiments reported here, we exploited an old, unheralded, and exceptionally simple paradigm to reveal the presence and nature of shape skeletons in human vision. When participants independently viewed a shape on a touch-sensitive tablet computer and simply tapped the shape anywhere they wished, the aggregated touches formed the shape’s medial-axis skeleton. This pattern held across several shape variations, demonstrating profound and predictable influences of even subtle border perturbations and amodally filled-in regions. This phenomenon reveals novel properties of shape representation and demonstrates (in an unusually direct way) how deep and otherwise-hidden visual processes can directly control simple behaviors, even while observers are completely unaware of their existence.","psychology"
"Stopping retrieval of unwanted memories has been characterized as a process that requires inhibition. However, little research has examined the relationship between control over memory retrieval and individual differences in inhibitory control. Higher levels of resting heart rate variability (HRV) are associated with greater inhibitory control, as indicated by better performance on a number of cognitive, affective, and motor tasks. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that higher levels of resting HRV predict enhanced memory inhibition as indexed by performance on the think/no-think task. Efforts to suppress no-think word pairs resulted in impaired recall for those items, as in past studies. Moreover, higher levels of resting HRV were associated with more successful suppression, as indicated by lower recall of the to-be-avoided stimuli relative to baseline stimuli. These findings are among the first to suggest that physiological markers of inhibitory control can be used to index a person’s capacity to control unwanted memories.","psychology"
"The positive effect of losses on performance has been explained as stemming from the increased weighting of losses relative to gains. We examine an alternative possibility whereby this effect is mediated by attentional processes. Using the dual-task paradigm, we expected that positive effects of losses on performance would emerge under attentional scarcity and diffuse to a concurrently presented task. In Study 1, decision performance was compared for a task that involved either gains or losses and was performed either alone or as a secondary task. The results showed a significant 40% improvement in performance in the loss condition, but only under conditions of resource scarcity, when the task was a secondary one. In Study 2, the same task was presented as a primary task. Again, losses were associated with improved performance in the secondary task. Given that this secondary task did not include losses, these findings demonstrate an attentional spillover effect.","psychology"
"Bilinguals rarely produce words in an unintended language. However, we induced such intrusion errors (e.g., saying el instead of he) in 32 Spanish-English bilinguals who read aloud single-language (English or Spanish) and mixed-language (haphazard mix of English and Spanish) paragraphs with English or Spanish word order. These bilinguals produced language intrusions almost exclusively in mixed-language paragraphs, and most often when attempting to produce dominant-language targets (accent-only errors also exhibited reversed language-dominance effects). Most intrusion errors occurred for function words, especially when they were not from the language that determined the word order in the paragraph. Eye movements showed that fixating a word in the nontarget language increased intrusion errors only for function words. Together, these results imply multiple mechanisms of language control, including (a) inhibition of the dominant language at both lexical and sublexical processing levels, (b) special retrieval mechanisms for function words in mixed-language utterances, and (c) attentional monitoring of the target word for its match with the intended language.","psychology"
"Using functional MRI, we examined how the affective experience of choice, the means by which individuals exercise control, is modulated by the valence of potential outcomes (gains, losses). When trials involved potential gains, participants reported liking cues predicting a choice opportunity better than cues predicting no choice opportunity—an effect that corresponded with blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) increases in ventral striatum (VS) activity. Surprisingly, no differences were observed between choice and no-choice cues when participants anticipated potential losses. Individual differences in subjective choice preference in the loss condition, however, corresponded to choice-related BOLD activity in VS. We conducted a second experiment to examine whether monetary losses were perceived differently in the context of simultaneous gains. When losses occurred in the absence of gains, participants showed an increased affective experience of choice—they reported greater liking of choice than no-choice trials, and VS activity was greater for choice than for no-choice cues. Collectively, the findings suggest that the affective experience of choice involves reward-processing circuitry when people anticipate appetitive and aversive outcomes, but the choice experience may be sensitive to context and individual differences.","psychology"
"The notion of person-environment fit implies that personal and contextual factors interact in influencing important life outcomes. Using data from 8,458 employed individuals, we examined the combined effects of individuals’ actual personality traits and jobs’ expert-rated personality demands on earnings. Results from a response surface analysis indicated that the fit between individuals’ actual personality and the personality demands of their jobs is a predictor of income. Conclusions of this combined analysis were partly opposite to conclusions reached in previous studies using conventional regression methods. Individuals can earn additional income of more than their monthly salary per year if they hold a job that fits their personality. Thus, at least for some traits, economic success depends not only on having a “successful personality” but also, in part, on finding the best niche for one’s personality. We discuss the findings with regard to labor-market policies and individuals’ job-selection strategies.","psychology"
"We tested whether affiliating beer brands with universities enhances the incentive salience of those brands for underage drinkers. In Study 1, 128 undergraduates viewed beer cues while event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded. Results showed that beer cues paired with in-group backgrounds (logos for students’ universities) evoked an enhanced P3 ERP component, a neural index of incentive salience. This effect varied according to students’ levels of identification with their university, and the amplitude of the P3 response prospectively predicted alcohol use over 1 month. In Study 2 ( N = 104), we used a naturalistic advertisement exposure to experimentally create in-group brand associations and found that this manipulation caused an increase in the incentive salience of the beer brand. These data provide the first evidence that marketing beer via affiliating it with students’ universities enhances the incentive salience of the brand for underage students and that this effect has implications for their alcohol involvement.","psychology"
"Existing evidence shows that more abstract mental representations are formed and more abstract language is used to characterize phenomena that are more distant from the self. Yet the precise form of the functional relationship between distance and linguistic abstractness is unknown. In four studies, we tested whether more abstract language is used in textual references to more geographically distant cities (Study 1), time points further into the past or future (Study 2), references to more socially distant people (Study 3), and references to a specific topic (Study 4). Using millions of linguistic productions from thousands of social-media users, we determined that linguistic concreteness is a curvilinear function of the logarithm of distance, and we discuss psychological underpinnings of the mathematical properties of this relationship. We also demonstrated that gradient curvilinear effects of geographic and temporal distance on concreteness are nearly identical, which suggests uniformity in representation of abstractness along multiple dimensions.","psychology"
"During close interactions with fellow group members, humans look into one another’s eyes, follow gaze, and quickly grasp emotion signals. The eye-catching morphology of human eyes, with unique eye whites, draws attention to the middle part, to the pupils, and their autonomic changes, which signal arousal, cognitive load, and interest (including social interest). Here, we examined whether and how these changes in a partner’s pupils are processed and how they affect the partner’s trustworthiness. Participants played incentivized trust games with virtual partners, whose pupils dilated, remained static, or constricted. Results showed that (a) participants trusted partners with dilating pupils and withheld trust from partners with constricting pupils, (b) participants’ pupils mimicked changes in their partners’ pupils, and (c) dilation mimicry predicted trust in in-group partners, whereas constriction mimicry did not. We suggest that pupil-contingent trust is in-group bounded and possibly evolved in and because of group life.","psychology"
"In all languages studied to date, distinct prosodic contours characterize different intention categories of infant-directed (ID) speech. This vocal behavior likely exists universally as a species-typical trait, but little research has examined whether listeners can accurately recognize intentions in ID speech using only vocal cues, without access to semantic information. We recorded native-English-speaking mothers producing four intention categories of utterances (prohibition, approval, comfort, and attention) as both ID and adult-directed (AD) speech, and we then presented the utterances to Shuar adults (South American hunter-horticulturalists). Shuar subjects were able to reliably distinguish ID from AD speech and were able to reliably recognize the intention categories in both types of speech, although performance was significantly better with ID speech. This is the first demonstration that adult listeners in an indigenous, nonindustrialized, and nonliterate culture can accurately infer intentions from both ID speech and AD speech in a language they do not speak.","psychology"
"Many languages without separate terms for green and blue are or were spoken in locations receiving above-average exposure to ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation. It has been proposed that this correlation is caused by premature lens aging. This conclusion was supported by an experiment in which younger observers used the term “blue” less often when they described simulated paint chips filtered through the equivalent of an older observer's lens—removing much short-wavelength light—than when they described the unfiltered versions of the same paint chips. Some stimuli that were called “blue” without simulated aging were called “green” when filtered. However, in the experiment reported here, we found that the proportion of “blue” color-name responses did not differ between younger subjects and older observers with known ocular media optical densities. Color naming for stimuli that were nominally green, blue-green, or blue was virtually identical for older and younger observers who viewed the same (unfiltered) stimuli. Our results are inconsistent with the lens-brunescence hypothesis.","psychology"
"In two experiments, visual search and speeded classification were used to study perception of hierarchical patterns among participants aged 5 to 23 years. Perception of global configurations of few-element patterns and local elements of many-element patterns showed large age-related improvements. Only minor age-related changes were observed in perception of global configurations of many-element patterns and local elements of few-element patterns. These results are consistent with prior microgenetic analyses using hierarchical patterns. On the one hand, the rapid and effortless grouping of many small elements and the individuation of few large elements both mature by age 5. In contrast, the time-consuming and effortful grouping of few large elements and the individuation of many small elements improve substantially with age, primarily between ages 5 and 10. These findings support the view that perceptual organization involves multiple processes that vary in time course, attentional demands, and developmental trajectories.","psychology"
"We tested 15-month-olds’ capacity to represent social-dominance hierarchies with more than two agents. Our results showed that infants found it harder to memorize dominance relations that were presented in an order that hindered the incremental formation of a single structure (Study 1). These results suggest that infants attempt to build structures incrementally, relation by relation, thereby simplifying the complex problem of recognizing a social structure. Infants also found circular dominance structures harder to process than linear dominance structures (Study 2). These expectations about the shape of structures may facilitate learning. Our results suggest that infants attempt to represent social structures composed of social relations. They indicate that human infants go beyond learning about individual social partners and their respective relations and form hypotheses about how social groups are organized.","psychology"
"Recent studies suggest that human memory systems are “tuned” to remember information that is processed in terms of its fitness value. When people are asked to rate the relevance of words to a survival scenario, performance on subsequent surprise memory tests exceeds that obtained after most other known encoding techniques. The present experiments explored this effect using survival scenarios designed to mimic the division of labor thought to characterize early hunter-gatherer societies. It has been suggested that males and females have different cognitive specializations due to the unique survival tasks (hunting and gathering, respectively) they typically performed during periods of human evolution; the present experiments tested whether such specializations might be apparent in memory for words rated for relevance to these activities. Males and females were asked to rate the relevance of random words to prototypical hunting and gathering scenarios or to matched, non-fitness-relevant control scenarios (gathering food on a scavenger hunt or in a hunting contest). Surprise retention tests revealed superior memory for the words when they were rated for relevance to hunting and gathering scenarios, compared with when they were rated for relevance to the control scenarios, but no sex differences were found in memory performance.","psychology"
"Even dissimilar tasks interfere with one another when done together. We used visual search to examine the underlying cause of such interference. In many models, visual search is a process of biased competition controlled by a template describing the target to be sought. When the display is processed, matching against this template guides attention to the target. We show that increasing template complexity increased interference with a dissimilar concurrent task, story memory. This result was independent of reaction time: Increases in template complexity were associated with no increase in search time in Experiment 1 and with a decrease in search time in Experiment 2. The results show that the dual-task demands of visual search reflect the complexity of the template used in task control, and that this factor can be isolated from other sources of difficulty.","psychology"
"Although most theories of choice are cognitive, recent research has emphasized the role of emotions. We used a novel context—the Mad Cow crisis in France—to investigate how emotions alter choice even when consequences are held constant. A field study showed that individuals reduced beef consumption in months after many newspaper articles featured the emotional label “Mad Cow,” but beef consumption was unaffected after articles featured scientific labels for the same disease. The reverse pattern held for the disease-related actions of a government bureaucracy. A lab study showed that the Mad Cow label induces people to make choices based solely on emotional reactions, whereas scientific labels induce people to consider their own probability judgments. Although the Mad Cow label produces less rational behavior than scientific labels, it is two to four times more common in the environment.","psychology"
"Eye movements in Sally-Anne false-belief tasks appear to reflect the ability to implicitly monitor the mental states of other individuals (theory of mind, or ToM). It has recently been proposed that an early-developing, efficient, and automatically operating ToM system subserves this ability. Surprisingly absent from the literature, however, is an empirical test of the influence of domain-general executive processing resources on this implicit ToM system. In the study reported here, a dual-task method was employed to investigate the impact of executive load on eye movements in an implicit Sally-Anne false-belief task. Under no-load conditions, adult participants displayed eye movement behavior consistent with implicit belief processing, whereas evidence for belief processing was absent for participants under cognitive load. These findings indicate that the cognitive system responsible for implicitly tracking beliefs draws at least minimally on executive processing resources. Thus, even the most low-level processing of beliefs appears to reflect a capacity-limited operation.","psychology"
"The present studies show that preferences change systematically depending on the global context and the measurement task Subjects evaluated apartments described by monthly rent and distance to campus using two different tasks (choices and attractiveness ratings) in two different global contexts (one with a narrow range of rents and a wide range of distances, and the other with a wide range of rents and a narrow range of distances) With the task held constant, preference orders for the same pair of apartments reversed in the two different contexts Similarly, with the context held constant, preference orders for the same pair of apartments reversed in the two tasks Taken together, the effects are startling Out of 25 apartments common to all four conditions, the preference rank of the apartment that was most expensive and closest to campus ranged from the 28th percentile to the 80th percentile We argue that, in the present experiments, the global context influences the scale values (or the perceptions of the attributes), and the task influences the weights (or the psychological importance) of the attributes","psychology"
"The definitions of negative reinforcer and negative reinforcement that are currently in nearly universal use are operationally awkward and confusing. The modest proposal for a minor revolution in the language of psychology is to replace the current definitions of positive as well as negative reinforcement with different ones derived from those proposed by E.L. Thorndike (1911) in Animal Intelligence. This revolution should gain popular support because it restores an element of common sense to psychology. It should appeal to science because it is operationally attractive and creates a situation in which important concepts have consistent implications for behavior.","psychology"
"Taking a cue from recent discoveries of directional bias in microsaccades during visual fixation, we investigated directional bias in tremor during manual pointing. Subjects memorized and then performed patterns of alternating postures and voluntary movements. The directions of the tiny movements occurring during periods of intended stillness were predictive of subsequent target-directed movements such that in the horizontal axis, relative to baseline, the frequency of tremor decreased and the amplitude of tremor increased before horizontal movements, but not before vertical movements. This effect was less pronounced in the finger than in the arm, forearm, and hand. Possible explanations of the effect are based on eye-limb coupling, decreasing stiffness in the axis of forthcoming movement, and release of inhibition. The discovery of directionally specific preparatory activity suggests that the simple task of holding still before moving may provide a new window into the processes that allow for the translation of intentions into actions.","psychology"
"Because men of higher genetic quality tend to be poorer partners and parents than men of lower genetic quality, women may profit from securing a stable investment from the latter, while obtaining good genes via extrapair mating with the former. Only if conception occurs, however, do the evolutionary benefits of such a strategy overcome its costs. Accordingly, we predicted that (a) partnered women should prefer attached men, because such men are more likely than single men to have pair-bonding qualities, and hence to be good replacement partners, and (b) this inclination should reverse when fertility rises, because attached men are less available for impromptu sex than single men. In this study, 208 women rated the attractiveness of men described as single or attached. As predicted, partnered women favored attached men at the low-fertility phases of the menstrual cycle, but preferred single men (if masculine, i.e., advertising good genetic quality) when conception risk was high.","psychology"
"Psychological investigations into the structure of well-being have been largely cross-sectional. However, longitudinal models are needed as Western societies work to improve individual well-being. The current multilevel-modeling study examined within-person dynamics of well-being over 8 years. I asked two questions: (a) How do life satisfaction and psychological well-being (measures drawn from two well-being research traditions) relate over time? and (b) do these relationships vary on the basis of individuals’ extraversion or neuroticism? Measures of life satisfaction and psychological well-being were collected in 8 consecutive years from 159 American adults in late midlife. A dispositional-life-satisfaction set point and yearly variation in life satisfaction both related to higher yearly psychological well-being. Neuroticism, but not extraversion, predicted a stronger within-person relationship between life satisfaction and psychological well-being. For participants with very low neuroticism, life satisfaction and psychological well-being varied independently. In sum, experiences of life satisfaction and psychological well-being converged for more neurotic individuals and diverged for more emotionally stable participants.","psychology"
"Increasing numbers of gender-nonconforming children are socially transitioning—changing pronouns to live as their identified genders. We studied a cohort of gender-nonconforming children ( n = 85) and contacted them again approximately 2 years later. When recontacted, 36 of the children had socially transitioned. We found that stronger cross-sex identification and preferences expressed by gender-nonconforming children at initial testing predicted whether they later socially transitioned. We then compared the gender-nonconforming children with groups of transitioned transgender children ( n = 84) and gender-conforming controls ( n = 85). Children from our longitudinal cohort who would later transition were highly similar to transgender children (children who had already socially transitioned) and to control children of the gender to which they would eventually transition. Gender-nonconforming children who would not go on to transition were different from these groups. These results suggest that (a) social transitions may be predictable from gender identification and preferences and (b) gender identification and preferences may not meaningfully differ before and after social transitions.","psychology"
"The contributions of gonadal hormones to the development of human behavioral sex differences are subjects of intense scientific and social interest. Isolated gonadotropin-releasing-hormone deficiency (IGD) is a rare endocrine disorder that can reveal a possible role of early gonadal hormones. IGD is characterized by low or absent gonadal hormone production after the first trimester of gestation, but external genitalia and hence gender of rearing are concordant with chromosomal and gonadal sex. We investigated recalled childhood gender nonconformity in men ( n = 65) and women ( n = 32) with IGD and typically developing men ( n = 463) and women ( n = 1,207). Men with IGD showed elevated childhood gender nonconformity, particularly if they also reported undescended testes at birth, a marker of low perinatal androgens. Women with IGD did not differ from typically developing women. These results indicate that early androgen exposure after the first trimester contributes to male-typical gender-role behaviors in childhood.","psychology"
"Bastian et al. (2014) found that sharing a painful experience promoted later intergroup cooperation. In Bastian et al.’s second experiment, 62 participants were assigned to groups of two to six people each. They performed either two painful or two painless tasks and then played an economic game. The present study consisted of two replications of the experiment: The first was a nonpreregistered pilot study ( N = 153 students from the Czech Republic), and the second was a preregistered direct replication ( N = 158 students from Slovakia). Important deviations from the original procedure were that (a) gender homogeneity of the small groups was balanced across the conditions and (b) the number of participants in each small group was fixed at three. No relevant effect of shared pain on cooperation emerged. The findings indicate that the true effect of shared pain on cooperation obtained in the original study may have been an overestimate or that the effect is not generally valid across various contexts.","psychology"
"Motor-based theories of facial expression recognition propose that the visual perception of facial expression is aided by sensorimotor processes that are also used for the production of the same expression. Accordingly, sensorimotor and visual processes should provide congruent emotional information about a facial expression. Here, we report evidence that challenges this view. Specifically, the repeated execution of facial expressions has the opposite effect on the recognition of a subsequent facial expression than the repeated viewing of facial expressions. Moreover, the findings of the motor condition, but not of the visual condition, were correlated with a nonsensory condition in which participants imagined an emotional situation. These results can be well accounted for by the idea that facial expression recognition is not always mediated by motor processes but can also be recognized on visual information alone.","psychology"
"When people are choosing among different options, context seems to play a vital role. For instance, adding a third option can increase the probability of choosing a similar dominating option. This attraction effect is one of the most widely studied phenomena in decision-making research. Its prevalence, however, has been challenged recently by the tainting hypothesis, according to which the inferior option contaminates the attribute space in which it is located, leading to a repulsion effect. In an attempt to test the tainting hypothesis and explore the conditions under which dominated options make dominating options look bad, we conducted four preregistered perceptual decision-making studies with a total of 301 participants. We identified two factors influencing individuals’ behavior: stimulus display and stimulus design. Our results contribute to a growing body of literature showing how presentation format influences behavior in preferential and perceptual decision-making tasks.","psychology"
"Although adults use metaphors to guide their thinking and reasoning, less is known about whether metaphors might facilitate cognition earlier in development. Previous research shows that preschoolers understand metaphors, but less is known about whether preschoolers can learn from metaphors. The current preregistered experiment investigated whether adults ( n = 64) and 3- and 4-year-olds ( n = 128) can use metaphors to make new inferences. In a between-subjects design, participants heard information about novel artifacts, conveyed through either only positive metaphors (e.g., “Daxes are suns”) or positive and negative metaphors (e.g., “Daxes are suns. Daxes are not clouds.”). In both conditions, participants of all ages successfully formed metaphor-consistent inferences about abstract, functional features of the artifacts (e.g., that daxes light up rather than let out water). Moreover, participants frequently provided explanations appealing to the metaphors when justifying their responses. Consequently, metaphors may be a powerful learning mechanism from early childhood onward.","psychology"
"Little is known about historical shifts in subjective age (i.e., how old individuals feel). Moving beyond the very few time-lagged cross-sectional cohort comparisons, we examined historical shifts in within-person trajectories of subjective age from midlife to advanced old age. We used cohort-comparative longitudinal data from middle-age and older adults in the German Ageing Survey ( N = 14,928; ~50% female) who lived in Germany and were between 40 and 85 years old when entering the study. They provided up to seven observations over 24 years. Results revealed that being born later in historical time is associated with feeling younger by 2% every birth-year decade and with less intraindividual change toward an older subjective age. Women reported feeling younger than men; this gender gap widened across cohorts. The association of higher education with younger subjective age became weaker across cohorts. Potential reasons for the subjective-rejuvenation effect across cohorts are discussed.","psychology"
"When a log burns, it transforms from a block of wood into a pile of ash. Such state changes are among the most dramatic ways objects change, going beyond mere changes of position or orientation. How does the mind represent changes of state? A foundational result in visual cognition is that memory extrapolates the positions of moving objects—a distortion called representational momentum. Here, five experiments ( N = 400 adults) exploited this phenomenon to investigate mental representations in state space. Participants who viewed objects undergoing state changes (e.g., ice melting, logs burning, or grapes shriveling) remembered them as more changed (e.g., more melted, burned, or shriveled) than they actually were. This pattern extended to several types of state changes, went beyond their low-level properties, and even adhered to their natural trajectories in state space. Thus, mental representations of objects actively incorporate how they change—not only in their relation to their environment, but also in their essential qualities.","psychology"
"We typically think of intuitive physics in terms of high-level cognition, but might aspects of physics also be extracted during lower-level visual processing? Might we not only think about physics, but also see it? We explored this using multiple tasks in online adult samples with objects covered by soft materials—as when you see a chair with a blanket draped over it—where you must account for the physical interactions between cloth, gravity, and object. In multiple change-detection experiments ( n = 200), observers from an online testing marketplace were better at detecting image changes involving underlying object structure versus those involving only the superficial folds of cloths—even when the latter were more extreme along several dimensions. And in probe-comparison experiments ( n = 100), performance was worse when both probes (vs. only one) appeared on image regions reflective of underlying object structure (equating visual properties). This work collectively shows how vision uses intuitive physics to recover the deeper underlying structure of scenes.","psychology"
"The goal of perception is to infer the most plausible source of sensory stimulation. Unisensory perception of temporal order, however, appears to require no inference, because the order of events can be uniquely determined from the order in which sensory signals arrive. Here, we demonstrate a novel perceptual illusion that casts doubt on this intuition: In three experiments ( N = 607), the experienced event timings were determined by causality in real time. Adult participants viewed a simple three-item sequence, ACB, which is typically remembered as ABC in line with principles of causality. When asked to indicate the time at which events B and C occurred, participants’ points of subjective simultaneity shifted so that the assumed cause B appeared earlier and the assumed effect C later, despite participants’ full attention and repeated viewings. This first demonstration of causality reversing perceived temporal order cannot be explained by postperceptual distortion, lapsed attention, or saccades.","psychology"
"Threats elicit physiological responses, the frequency and intensity of which have implications for survival. Ethical and practical limitations on human laboratory manipulations present barriers to studying immersive threat. Furthermore, few investigations have examined group effects and concordance with subjective emotional experiences to threat. The current preregistered study measured electrodermal activity in 156 adults while they participated in small groups in a 30-min haunted-house experience involving various immersive threats. Results revealed positive associations between (a) friends and tonic arousal, (b) unexpected attacks and phasic activity (frequency and amplitude), (c) subjective fear and phasic frequency, and (d) dissociable sensitization effects linked to baseline orienting response. Findings demonstrate the relevance of (a) social dynamics (friends vs. strangers) for tonic arousal and (b) subjective fear and threat predictability for phasic arousal.","psychology"
"When searching for a target object, we engage in a continuous “look-identify” cycle in which we use known features of the target to guide attention toward potential targets and then to decide whether the selected object is indeed the target. Target information in memory (the target template or attentional template) is typically characterized as having a single, fixed source. However, debate has recently emerged over whether flexibility in the target template is relational or optimal. On the basis of evidence from two experiments using college students ( Ns = 30 and 70, respectively), we propose that initial guidance of attention uses a coarse relational code, but subsequent decisions use an optimal code. Our results offer a novel perspective that the precision of template information differs when guiding sensory selection and when making identity decisions during visual search.","psychology"
"Decades of research from across the globe highlight unequal and unfair division of household labor as a key factor that leads to relationship distress and demise. But does it have to? Testing a priori predictions across three samples of individuals cohabiting with a romantic partner during the COVID-19 pandemic ( N = 2,193, including 476 couples), we found an important exception to this rule. People who reported doing more of the household labor and who perceived the division as more unfair were less satisfied across the early weeks and ensuing months of the pandemic, but these negative effects disappeared when people felt appreciated by their partners. Feeling appreciated also appeared to buffer against the negative effects of doing less, suggesting that feeling appreciated may offset the relational costs of unequal division of labor, regardless of who contributes more. These findings generalized across gender, employment status, age, socioeconomic status, and relationship length.","psychology"
"In addition to seeing objects that are directly in view, we also represent objects that are merely implied (e.g., by occlusion, motion, and other cues). What can imply the presence of an object? Here, we explored (in three preregistered experiments; N = 360 adults) the role of physical interaction in creating impressions of objects that are not actually present. After seeing an actor collide with an invisible wall or step onto an invisible box, participants gave facilitated responses to actual, visible surfaces that appeared where the implied wall or box had been—a Stroop-like pattern of facilitation and interference that suggested automatic inferences about the relevant implied surfaces. Follow-up experiments ruled out confounding geometric cues and anticipatory responses. We suggest that physical interactions can trigger representations of the participating surfaces such that we automatically infer the presence of objects implied only by their physical consequences.","psychology"
"When choosing social partners, people prefer good cooperators (all else being equal). Given this preference, people wishing to be chosen can either increase their own cooperation to become more desirable or suppress others’ cooperation to make them less desirable. Previous research shows that very cooperative people sometimes get punished (“antisocial punishment”) or criticized (“do-gooder derogation”) in many cultures. Here, we used a public-goods game with punishment to test whether antisocial punishment is used as a means of competing to be chosen by suppressing others’ cooperation. As predicted, there was more antisocial punishment when participants were competing to be chosen for a subsequent cooperative task (a trust game) than without a subsequent task. This difference in antisocial punishment cannot be explained by differences in contributions, moralistic punishment, or confusion. This suggests that antisocial punishment is a social strategy that low cooperators use to avoid looking bad when high cooperators escalate cooperation.","psychology"
"Despite the ubiquitous use of Pavlovian fear conditioning as a model for fear learning, the highly predictable conditions used in the laboratory do not resemble real-world conditions, in which dangerous situations can lead to unpleasant outcomes in unpredictable ways. In the current experiments, we varied the timing of aversive events after predictive cues in rodents and discovered that temporal ambiguity of aversive events greatly enhances fear. During fear conditioning with unpredictably timed aversive events, pharmacological inactivation of the dorsal hippocampus or optogenetic silencing of cornu ammonis 1 cells during aversive negative prediction errors prevented this enhancement of fear without affecting fear learning for predictable events. Dorsal hippocampal inactivation also prevented ambiguity-related enhancement of fear during auditory fear conditioning under a partial-reinforcement schedule. These results reveal that information about the timing and occurrence of aversive events is rapidly acquired and that unexpectedly timed or omitted aversive events generate hippocampal signals to enhance fear learning.","psychology"
"Although the time adolescents spend with digital technologies has sparked widespread concerns that their use might be negatively associated with mental well-being, these potential deleterious influences have not been rigorously studied. Using a preregistered plan for analyzing data collected from a representative sample of English adolescents ( n = 120,115), we obtained evidence that the links between digital-screen time and mental well-being are described by quadratic functions. Further, our results showed that these links vary as a function of when digital technologies are used (i.e., weekday vs. weekend), suggesting that a full understanding of the impact of these recreational activities will require examining their functionality among other daily pursuits. Overall, the evidence indicated that moderate use of digital technology is not intrinsically harmful and may be advantageous in a connected world. The findings inform recommendations for limiting adolescents’ technology use and provide a template for conducting rigorous investigations into the relations between digital technology and children’s and adolescents’ health.","psychology"
"Gestures help people think and can help problem solvers generate new ideas. We conducted two experiments exploring the self-oriented function of gesture in a novel domain: creative thinking. In Experiment 1, we explored the relationship between children’s spontaneous gesture production and their ability to generate novel uses for everyday items (alternative-uses task). There was a significant correlation between children’s creative fluency and their gesture production, and the majority of children’s gestures depicted an action on the target object. Restricting children from gesturing did not significantly reduce their fluency, however. In Experiment 2, we encouraged children to gesture, and this significantly boosted their generation of creative ideas. These findings demonstrate that gestures serve an important self-oriented function and can assist creative thinking.","psychology"
"Three studies conducted among fifth and sixth graders examined how school contexts disrupt the achievement of working-class students by staging unfair comparison with their advantaged middle-class peers. In regular classrooms, differences in performance among students are usually showcased in a way that does not acknowledge the advantage (i.e., higher cultural capital) experienced by middle-class students, whose upbringing affords them more familiarity with the academic culture than their working-class peers have. Results of Study 1 revealed that rendering differences in performance visible in the classroom by having students raise their hands was enough to undermine the achievement of working-class students. In Studies 2 and 3, we manipulated students’ familiarity with an arbitrary standard as a proxy for social class. Our results suggest that classroom settings that make differences in performance visible undermine the achievement of the students who are less familiar with academic culture. In Study 3, we showed that being aware of the advantage in familiarity with a task restores the performance of the students who have less familiarity with the task.","psychology"
"People feel tired or depleted after exerting mental effort. But even preregistered studies often fail to find effects of exerting effort on behavioral performance in the laboratory or elucidate the underlying psychology. We tested a new paradigm in four preregistered within-subjects studies ( N = 686). An initial high-demand task reliably elicited very strong effort phenomenology compared with a low-demand task. Afterward, participants completed a Stroop task. We used drift-diffusion modeling to obtain the boundary (response caution) and drift-rate (information-processing speed) parameters. Bayesian analyses indicated that the high-demand manipulation reduced boundary but not drift rate. Increased effort sensations further predicted reduced boundary. However, our demand manipulation did not affect subsequent inhibition, as assessed with traditional Stroop behavioral measures and additional diffusion-model analyses for conflict tasks. Thus, effort exertion reduced response caution rather than inhibitory control, suggesting that after exerting effort, people disengage and become uninterested in exerting further effort.","psychology"
"Polygenic scores now explain approximately 10% of the variation in educational attainment. However, they capture not only genetic propensity but also information about the family environment. This is because of passive gene–environment correlation, whereby the correlation between offspring and parent genotypes results in an association between offspring genotypes and the rearing environment. We measured passive gene–environment correlation using information on 6,311 adoptees in the UK Biobank. Adoptees’ genotypes were less correlated with their rearing environments because they did not share genes with their adoptive parents. We found that polygenic scores were twice as predictive of years of education in nonadopted individuals compared with adoptees ( R2s = .074 vs. .037, p = 8.23 × 10−24). Individuals in the lowest decile of polygenic scores for education attained significantly more education if they were adopted, possibly because of educationally supportive adoptive environments. Overall, these results suggest that genetic influences on education are mediated via the home environment.","psychology"
"Does the perceptual system for looking at the world overlap with the conceptual system for thinking about it? We conducted two experiments ( N = 403) to investigate this question. Experiment 1 showed that when people make simple semantic judgments on words, interference from a concurrent visual task scales in proportion to how much visual experience they have with the things the words refer to. Experiment 2 showed that when people make the same judgments on the very same words, interference from a concurrent manual task scales in proportion to how much manual (but critically, not visual) experience people have with those same things. These results suggest that the meanings of frequently visually experienced things are represented (in part) in the visual system used for actually seeing them, that this visually represented information is a functional part of conceptual knowledge, and that the extent of these visual representations is influenced by visual experience.","psychology"
"Experts in domains such as music or sports often start training early. It has been suggested that this may reflect a sensitive period in childhood for skill acquisition. However, it could be that familial factors (e.g., genetics) contribute to the association. Here, we examined the effect of age of onset of musical training on musical aptitude and achievement in professional musicians ( n = 310) and twins ( n = 7,786). In line with previous literature, results showed that an earlier age of onset was associated with higher aptitude and achievement in both samples. After we adjusted for lifetime practice hours, age of onset was associated only with aptitude ( p &lt; .001; achievement: p &gt; .14). Twin analyses showed that the association with aptitude was fully explained by familial factors. Thus, these findings provide little support for a sensitive period for music but highlight that familiar factors play an important role for associations between age of onset of training and skills in adulthood.","psychology"
"Patterns of discrimination are often complex (i.e., multiplicative), with different identities combining to yield especially potent discrimination. For example, Black men are disproportionately stopped by police to a degree that cannot be explained by the simple (i.e., additive) effects of being Black and being male. Researchers often posit corresponding mental representations (e.g., intersectional stereotypes for Black men) to account for these complex outcomes. We suggest that complex discrimination can be explained by simple stereotypes combined with threshold models of behavior—for example, “if someone’s threat level seems higher than X, stop that person.” Simulations provide proof of this concept. We show how gender-by-race discrimination in both promotions and police stops can be explained by simple stereotypes. We also explore race-by-age discrimination in police stops, in which racial disparities are greater for young adolescents. This work suggests that complex behaviors can sometimes arise from relatively simple cognitions.","psychology"
"When estimating unknown quantities, people insufficiently adjust from values they have previously considered, a phenomenon known as anchoring. We suggest that anchoring is at least partially caused by a desire to avoid making extreme adjustments. In seven studies ( N = 5,279), we found that transparently irrelevant cues of extremeness influenced people’s adjustments from anchors. In Studies 1–6, participants were less likely to adjust beyond a particular amount when that amount was closer to the maximum allowable adjustment. For example, in Study 5, participants were less likely to adjust by at least 6 units when they were allowed to adjust by a maximum of 6 units than by a maximum of 15 units. In Study 7, participants adjusted less after considering whether an outcome would be within a smaller distance of the anchor. These results suggest that anchoring effects may reflect a desire to avoid adjustments that feel too extreme.","psychology"
"Several theories predict that income inequality may produce increased racial bias, but robust tests of this hypothesis are lacking. We examined this relationship at the U.S. state level from 2004 to 2015 using Internal Revenue Service–based income-inequality statistics and two large-scale racial-bias data sources: Project Implicit ( N = 1,554,109) and Google Trends. Using a multimethod approach, we found evidence of a significant positive within-state association between income inequality and Whites’ explicit racial bias. However, the effect was small, with income inequality accounting for 0.4% to 0.7% of within-state variation in racial bias, and was also contingent on model specification, with results dependent on the measure of income inequality used. We found no conclusive evidence linking income inequality to implicit racial bias or racially offensive Google searches. Overall, our findings admit multiple interpretations, but we discuss why statistically small effects of income inequality on explicit racial bias may nonetheless be socially meaningful.","psychology"
"It is commonly assumed that inner speech—the experience of thought as occurring in a natural language—is a human universal. Recent evidence, however, suggests that the experience of inner speech in adults varies from near constant to nonexistent. We propose a name for a lack of the experience of inner speech—anendophasia—and report four studies examining some of its behavioral consequences. We found that adults who reported low levels of inner speech ( N = 46) had lower performance on a verbal working memory task and more difficulty performing rhyme judgments compared with adults who reported high levels of inner speech ( N = 47). Task-switching performance—previously linked to endogenous verbal cueing—and categorical effects on perceptual judgments were unrelated to differences in inner speech.","psychology"
"People perceive out-groups, minorities, and novel groups more negatively than in-groups, majorities, and familiar groups. Previous research has argued that such intergroup biases may be caused by the order in which people typically encounter social groups. Groups that are relatively novel to perceivers (e.g., out-groups, minorities) are primarily associated with distinct attributes that differentiate them from familiar groups. Because distinct attributes are typically negative, attitudes toward novel groups are negatively biased. Five experiments ( N = 2,615 adults) confirmed the generalizability of the novel groups’ disadvantage to different aspects of attitude formation (i.e., evaluations, memory, stereotyping), to cases with more than two groups, and to cases in which groups were majority/minority or in-groups/out-groups. Our findings revealed a remarkably robust influence of learning order in the formation of group attitudes, and they imply that people often perceive novel groups more negatively than they actually are.","psychology"
"Recent research suggests imagery is functionally equivalent to a weak form of visual perception. Here we report evidence across five independent experiments on adults that perception and imagery are supported by fundamentally different mechanisms: Whereas perceptual representations are largely formed via increases in excitatory activity, imagery representations are largely supported by modulating nonimagined content. We developed two behavioral techniques that allowed us to first put the visual system into a state of adaptation and then probe the additivity of perception and imagery. If imagery drives similar excitatory visual activity to perception, pairing imagery with perceptual adapters should increase the state of adaptation. Whereas pairing weak perception with adapters increased measures of adaptation, pairing imagery reversed their effects. Further experiments demonstrated that these nonadditive effects were due to imagery weakening representations of nonimagined content. Together these data provide empirical evidence that the brain uses categorically different mechanisms to represent imagery and perception.","psychology"
"Humans and nonhuman animals share an approximate number system (ANS) that permits estimation and rough calculation of quantities without symbols. Recent studies show a correlation between the acuity of the ANS and performance in symbolic math throughout development and into adulthood, which suggests that the ANS may serve as a cognitive foundation for the uniquely human capacity for symbolic math. Such a proposition leads to the untested prediction that training aimed at improving ANS performance will transfer to improvement in symbolic-math ability. In the two experiments reported here, we showed that ANS training on approximate addition and subtraction of arrays of dots selectively improved symbolic addition and subtraction. This finding strongly supports the hypothesis that complex math skills are fundamentally linked to rudimentary preverbal quantitative abilities and provides the first direct evidence that the ANS and symbolic math may be causally related. It also raises the possibility that interventions aimed at the ANS could benefit children and adults who struggle with math.","psychology"
"As a foundation for studies of human cognitive aging, it is important to know the stability of individual differences in cognitive ability across the life course. Few studies of cognitive ability have tested the same individuals in youth and old age. We examined the stability and concurrent and predictive validity of individual differences in the same intelligence test administered to the same individuals (the Lothian Birth Cohort of 1921, N = 106) at ages 11 and 90 years. The correlation of Moray House Test scores between age 11 and age 90 was .54 (.67 when corrected for range restriction). This is a valuable foundation for estimating the extent to which cognitive-ability differences in very old age are accounted for by the lifelong stable trait and by the causes of cognitive change across the life course. Moray House Test scores showed strong concurrent and predictive validity with “gold standard” cognitive tests at ages 11 and 90.","psychology"
"A central question in cognitive science is whether natural language provides combinatorial operations that are essential to diverse domains of thought. In the study reported here, we addressed this issue by examining the role of linguistic mechanisms in forging the hierarchical structures of algebra. In a 3-T functional MRI experiment, we showed that processing of the syntax-like operations of algebra does not rely on the neural mechanisms of natural language. Our findings indicate that processing the syntax of language elicits the known substrate of linguistic competence, whereas algebraic operations recruit bilateral parietal brain regions previously implicated in the representation of magnitude. This double dissociation argues against the view that language provides the structure of thought across all cognitive domains.","psychology"
"Prominent theories highlight the importance of bodily perception for self-consciousness, but it is currently not known whether bodily perception is based on interoceptive or exteroceptive signals or on integrated signals from these anatomically distinct systems. In the research reported here, we combined both types of signals by surreptitiously providing participants with visual exteroceptive information about their heartbeat: A real-time video image of a periodically illuminated silhouette outlined participants’ (projected, “virtual”) bodies and flashed in synchrony with their heartbeats. We investigated whether these “cardio-visual” signals could modulate bodily self-consciousness and tactile perception. We report two main findings. First, synchronous cardio-visual signals increased self-identification with and self-location toward the virtual body, and second, they altered the perception of tactile stimuli applied to participants’ backs so that touch was mislocalized toward the virtual body. We argue that the integration of signals from the inside and the outside of the human body is a fundamental neurobiological process underlying self-consciousness.","psychology"
"The image of a material's surface varies not only with viewing and illumination conditions, but also with the material's surface properties, including its 3-D texture and specularity. Previous studies on the visual perception of surface material have typically focused on single material properties, ignoring possible interactions. In this study, we used a conjoint-measurement design to determine how observers represent perceived 3-D texture (“bumpiness”) and specularity (“glossiness”) and modeled how each of these two surface-material properties affects perception of the other. Observers made judgments of bumpiness and glossiness of surfaces that varied in both surface texture and specularity. We quantified how changes in each surface-material property affected judgments of the other and found that a simple additive model captured visual perception of texture and specularity and their interaction. Conjoint measurement is potentially a powerful tool for analyzing perception of surface material in realistic environments.","psychology"
"An experience-sampling study of 124 undergraduates, pretested on complex memory-span tasks, examined the relation between working memory capacity (WMC) and the experience of mind wandering in daily life. Over 7 days, personal digital assistants signaled subjects eight times daily to report immediately whether their thoughts had wandered from their current activity, and to describe their psychological and physical context. WMC moderated the relation between mind wandering and activities' cognitive demand. During challenging activities requiring concentration and effort, higher-WMC subjects maintained on-task thoughts better, and mind-wandered less, than did lower-WMC subjects. The results were therefore consistent with theories of WMC emphasizing the role of executive attention and control processes in determining individual differences and their cognitive consequences.","psychology"
"The use of dietary supplements and the health status of individuals have an asymmetrical relationship: The growing market for dietary supplements appears not to be associated with an improvement in public health. Building on the notion of licensing, or the tendency for positive choices to license subsequent self-indulgent choices, we argue that because dietary supplements are perceived as conferring health advantages, use of such supplements may create an illusory sense of invulnerability that disinhibits unhealthy behaviors. In two experiments, participants who took placebo pills that they believed were dietary supplements exhibited the licensing effect across multiple forms of health-related behavior: They expressed less desire to engage in exercise and more desire to engage in hedonic activities (Experiment 1), expressed greater preference for a buffet over an organic meal (Experiment 1), and walked less to benefit their health (Experiment 2) compared with participants who were told the pills were a placebo. A mediational analysis indicated that perceived invulnerability was an underlying mechanism for these effects. Thus, a license associated with the use of dietary supplements may operate within cycles of behaviors that alternately protect and endanger health.","psychology"
"When participants search for a target letter while reading for comprehension, they miss more instances if the target letter is embedded in frequent function words than in less frequent content words. This phenomenon, called the missing-letter effect, has been considered a window on the cognitive mechanisms involved in the visual processing of written language. In the present study, one group of participants read two texts for comprehension while searching for a target letter, and another group listened to a narration of the same two texts while listening for the target letter’s corresponding phoneme. The ubiquitous missing-letter effect was replicated and extended to a missing-phoneme effect. Item-based correlations between the reading and listening tasks were high, which led us to conclude that both tasks involve cognitive processes that reading and listening have in common and that both processes are rooted in psycholinguistically driven allocation of attention.","psychology"
"People often fail to follow through on good intentions. While limited self-control is frequently the culprit, another cause is simply forgetting to enact intentions when opportunities arise. We introduce a novel, potent approach to facilitating follow-through: the reminders-through-association approach. This approach involves associating intentions (e.g., to mail a letter on your desk tomorrow) with distinctive cues that will capture attention when you have opportunities to act on those intentions (e.g., Valentine’s Day flowers that arrived late yesterday, which are sitting on your desk). We showed that cue-based reminders are more potent when the cues they employ are distinctive relative to (a) other regularly encountered stimuli and (b) other stimuli encountered concurrently. Further, they can be more effective than written or electronic reminder messages, and they are undervalued and underused. The reminders-through-association approach, developed by integrating and expanding on past research on self-control, reminders, and prospective memory, can be a powerful tool for policymakers and individuals.","psychology"
"Long-term collaborative relationships require that any jointly produced resources be shared in mutually satisfactory ways. Prototypically, this sharing involves partners dividing up simultaneously available resources, but sometimes the collaboration makes a resource available to only one individual, and any sharing of resources must take place across repeated instances over time. Here, we show that beginning at 5 years of age, human children stabilize cooperation in such cases by taking turns across instances of obtaining a resource. In contrast, chimpanzees do not take turns in this way, and so their collaboration tends to disintegrate over time. Alternating turns in obtaining a collaboratively produced resource does not necessarily require a prosocial concern for the other, but rather requires only a strategic judgment that partners need incentives to continue collaborating. These results suggest that human beings are adapted for thinking strategically in ways that sustain long-term cooperative relationships and that are absent in their nearest primate relatives.","psychology"
"The educational, occupational, and creative accomplishments of the profoundly gifted participants (IQs ⩾ 160) in the Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth (SMPY) are astounding, but are they representative of equally able 12-year-olds? Duke University’s Talent Identification Program (TIP) identified 259 young adolescents who were equally gifted. By age 40, their life accomplishments also were extraordinary: Thirty-seven percent had earned doctorates, 7.5% had achieved academic tenure (4.3% at research-intensive universities), and 9% held patents; many were high-level leaders in major organizations. As was the case for the SMPY sample before them, differential ability strengths predicted their contrasting and eventual developmental trajectories—even though essentially all participants possessed both mathematical and verbal reasoning abilities far superior to those of typical Ph.D. recipients. Individuals, even profoundly gifted ones, primarily do what they are best at. Differences in ability patterns, like differences in interests, guide development along different paths, but ability level, coupled with commitment, determines whether and the extent to which noteworthy accomplishments are reached if opportunity presents itself.","psychology"
"The idea that choices alter preferences has been widely studied in psychology, yet prior research has focused primarily on choices for which all alternatives were salient at the time of choice. Opportunity costs capture the value of the best forgone alternative and should be considered as part of any decision process, yet people often neglect them. How does the salience of opportunity costs at the time of choice influence subsequent evaluations of chosen and forgone options? In three experiments, we found that there was a larger postchoice spread between evaluations of focal options and opportunity costs when opportunity costs were explicit at the time of choice than when they remained implicit.","psychology"
"Preschools may reduce inequalities in early academic achievement by providing children from disadvantaged families with higher-quality learning environments than they would otherwise receive. In this study, longitudinal data from a nationally representative sample of more than 600 twin pairs were used to estimate the contributions of genes, the shared environment, and the nonshared environment to cognition and achievement scores in children enrolled versus not enrolled in preschool. Attending preschool at age 4 was associated with reductions in shared environmental influences on reading and math skills at age 5, but was not associated with the magnitude of shared environmental influences on cognition at age 2. These prospective effects were mediated by reductions in achievement gaps associated with minority status, socioeconomic status, and ratings of parental stimulation of cognitive development. Lower socioeconomic status was associated with lower rates of preschool enrollment, which suggests that the very children who would benefit most from preschools are the least likely to be enrolled in them.","psychology"
"Given evidence demonstrating that infants 3 months of age and younger can utilize the Gestalt principle of lightness similarity to group visually presented elements into organized percepts, four experiments using the familiarization/novelty-preference procedure were conducted to determine whether infants can also organize visual pattern information in accord with the Gestalt principle of form similarity. In Experiments 1 and 2, 6- to 7-month-olds, but not 3- to 4-month-olds, presented with generalization and discrimination tasks involving arrays of X and O elements responded as if they organized the elements into columns or rows based on form similarity. Experiments 3 and 4 demonstrated that the failure of the young infants to use form similarity was not due to insufficient processing time or the inability to discriminate between the individual X and O elements. The results suggest that different Gestalt principles may become functional over different time courses of development, and that not all principles are automatically deployed in the manner originally proposed by Gestalt theorists.","psychology"
"Three experiments were conducted to investigate whether surprising color singletons capture attention. Participants performed a visual search task in which a target letter had to be detected among distractor letters. Experiments 1 and 2 assessed accuracy as the dependent variable. In Experiment 1, the unannounced presentation of a color singleton 500 ms prior to the letters (and in the same position as the target letter) resulted in better performance than in the preceding conjunction search segment, in which no singleton was presented, and performance was as good in this surprise-singleton trial as in the following feature search segment, in which the singleton always coincided with the target. In contrast, no improvement was observed when the color singleton was presented simultaneously with the letters in Experiment 2, indicating that attentional capture occurred later in the surprise trial than in the feature search segment. In Experiment 3, set size was varied, and reaction time was the dependent variable. Reaction time depended on set size in the conjunction search segment, but not in the surprise trial nor in the feature search segment. The results of the three experiments support the view that surprising color singletons capture attention independently of a corresponding attentional set.","psychology"
"The visual system relies on several heuristics to direct attention to important locations and objects. One of these mechanisms directs attention to sudden changes in the environment. Although a substantial body of research suggests that this capture of attention occurs only for the abrupt appearance of a new perceptual object, more recent evidence shows that some luminance-based transients (e.g., motion and looming) and some types of brightness change also capture attention. These findings show that new objects are not necessary for attention capture. The present study tested whether they are even sufficient. That is, does a new object attract attention because the visual system is sensitive to new objects or because it is sensitive to the transients that new objects create? In two experiments using a visual search task, new objects did not capture attention unless they created a strong local luminance transient.","psychology"
"In a 9-year longitudinal investigation, 4 subjects learned and relearned 300 English-foreign language word pairs. Either 13 or 26 relearning sessions were administered at intervals of 14, 28, or 56 days. Retention was tested for 1.2.3. or 5 years after training terminated. The longer intersession intervals slowed down acquisition slightly, but this disadvantage during training was offset by substantially higher retention. Thirteen retraining sessions spaced at 56 days yielded retention comparable to 26 sessions spaced at 14 days. The retention benefit due to additional sessions was independent of the benefit due to spacing, and both variables facilitated retention of words regardless of difficulty level and of the consistency of retrieval during training. The benefits of spaced retrieval practice to long-term maintenance of access to academic knowledge areas are discussed.","psychology"
"When describing visual scenes, speakers typically gaze at objects while preparing their names. In a study of the relation between eye movements and speech, a corpus of self-corrected speech errors was analyzed. If errors result from rushed word preparation, insufficient visual information, or failure to check prepared names against objects, speakers should spend less time gazing at referents before uttering errors than before uttering correct names. Counter to predictions, gazes to referents before errors (e.g., gazes to an axe before saying “ham-” [hammer]) highly resembled gazes to referents before correct names (e.g., gazes to an axe before saying “axe”). However, speakers gazed at referents for more time after initiating erroneous compared with correct names, apparently while they prepared corrections. Assuming that gaze nonetheless reflects word preparation, errors were not associated with insufficient preparation. Nor were errors systematically associated with decreased inspection of objects. Like gesture, gaze may accurately reflect a speaker's intentions even when the accompanying speech does not.","psychology"
"Motion parallax, the ability to recover depth from retinal motion generated by observer translation, is important for visual depth perception. Recent work indicates that the perception of depth from motion parallax relies on the slow eye movement system. It is well known that ethanol intoxication reduces the gain of this system, and this produces the horizontal gaze nystagmus that law enforcement's field sobriety test is intended to reveal. The current study demonstrates that because of its influence on the slow eye movement system, ethanol intoxication impairs the perception of depth from motion parallax. Thresholds in a motion parallax task were significantly increased by acute ethanol intoxication, whereas thresholds for an identical test relying on binocular disparity were unaffected. Perhaps a failure of motion parallax plays a role in alcohol-related driving accidents; because of the effects of alcohol on eye movements, intoxicated drivers may have inaccurate or inadequate information for judging the relative depth of obstacles from motion parallax.","psychology"
"Seven decades have elapsed since Leo Kanner described the syndrome he termed early infantile autism. Over this time, and particularly over the past two decades, noteworthy changes have occurred in how the condition is conceptualized. Here we provide an overview of these changes, beginning with a brief discussion of the significance of classification in general before discussing Kanner's original paper and subsequent changes. We touch on relevant issues, such as comorbidity, dimensional aspects of diagnosis and screening, and the complex issue of diagnosis relative to eligibility for services. Approaches to diagnosis have tended to swing from emphasizing overarching groups (lumping) to focusing on potentially distinct subgroups (splitting). Autism raises particular problems given the broad range of syndrome expression over age and developmental level. The most recent revision of the American Psychiatric Association's diagnostic taxonomy marks a significant departure from its predecessor and has been the focus of much debate. It remains unclear which of the currently existing categorical approaches will ultimately be most widely applied. We hope to convey a sense of areas in which consensus has been achieved and areas of continued controversy.","psychology"
"Because structural equation modeling (SEM) has become a very popular data-analytic technique, it is important for clinical scientists to have a balanced perception of its strengths and limitations. We review several strengths of SEM, with a particular focus on recent innovations (e.g., latent growth modeling, multilevel SEM models, and approaches for dealing with missing data and with violations of normality assumptions) that underscore how SEM has become a broad data-analytic framework with flexible and unique capabilities. We also consider several limitations of SEM and some misconceptions that it tends to elicit. Major themes emphasized are the problem of omitted variables, the importance of lower-order model components, potential limitations of models judged to be well fitting, the inaccuracy of some commonly used rules of thumb, and the importance of study design. Throughout, we offer recommendations for the conduct of SEM analyses and the reporting of results.","psychology"

"This article examines issues and challenges in the design of cultural adaptations that are developed from an original evidence-based intervention (EBI). Recently emerging multistep frameworks or stage models are examined, as these can systematically guide the development of culturally adapted EBIs. Critical issues are also presented regarding whether and how such adaptations may be conducted, and empirical evidence is presented regarding the effectiveness of such cultural adaptations. Recent evidence suggests that these cultural adaptations are effective when applied with certain subcultural groups, although they are less effective when applied with other subcultural groups. Generally, current evidence regarding the effectiveness of cultural adaptations is promising but mixed. Further research is needed to obtain more definitive conclusions regarding the efficacy and effectiveness of culturally adapted EBIs. Directions for future research and recommendations are presented to guide the development of a new generation of culturally adapted EBIs.","psychology"
"The development of children's emotion-related self-regulation appears to be related to, and likely involved in, many aspects of children's development. In this review, the distinction between effortful self-regulatory processes and those that are somewhat less voluntary is discussed, and literature on the former capacities is reviewed. Emotion-related self-regulation develops rapidly in the early years of life and improves more slowly into adulthood. Individual differences in children's self-regulation are fairly stable after the first year or two of life. Such individual differences are inversely related to at least some types of externalizing problems. Findings for internalizing problems are less consistent and robust, although emotion-related self-regulation appears to be inversely related to internalizing problems after the early years. Self-regulatory capacities have been related to both genetic and environmental factors and their interaction. Some interventions designed to foster self-regulation and, hence, reduce maladjustment, have proved to be at least partially effective.","psychology"
"During the past two decades, research in the field of depression and cardiovascular disorders has exploded. Multiple studies have demonstrated that depression is more prevalent in populations with cardiovascular disease, is a robust risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disease in healthy populations, and is predictive of adverse outcomes (such as myocardial infarction and death) among populations with preexisting cardiovascular disease. Mechanistic studies have shown that poor health behaviors, such as physical inactivity, medication nonadherence, and smoking, strongly contribute to this association. Small randomized trials have found that antidepressant therapies may improve cardiac outcomes. Based on this accumulating evidence, the American Heart Association has recommended routine screening for depression in all patients with coronary heart disease. This review examines the key epidemiological literature on depression and cardiovascular disorders and discusses our current understanding of the mechanisms responsible for this association. We also examine current recommendations for screening, diagnosis, and management of depression. We conclude by highlighting new research areas and discussing therapeutic management of depression in patients with cardiovascular disorders.","psychology"
"Should excessive and problematic engagement in nonsubstance use behaviors be mental disorders? The fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) repositioned gambling disorder in the substance use disorders section and introduced Internet gaming disorder in the research appendix; the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) is also considering it. This article outlines pros and cons of considering behavioral addictions as mental disorders and also reviews the DSM-5 decision-making processes. It focuses on three conditions: gambling disorder, Internet gaming disorder (IGD), and Internet addiction (IA). We detail assessment methods and prevalence rates for these conditions and outline psychiatric comorbidities, demographic and biological risk factors, and promising treatment approaches. We also briefly discuss other putative behavioral addictions: eating/food, sex, exercise, shopping, and tanning “addictions.” Overall, data are inconclusive, and consistent terminology and methodology are needed to define and evaluate these conditions more fully prior to considering them mental disorders.","psychology"
"Before the 1980s, no randomized controlled trials had been carried out to test whether major depressive episodes could be prevented. In the past 30 years, several trials have reported success in reducing the incidence (the number of new cases) of major depressive episodes. These studies suggest that major depression can be prevented. Given the large burden of disease caused by major depression, it is time for substantial systematic efforts to replicate these studies, carry out multisite trials, and widely disseminate prevention interventions found to be effective. The present review examines the conceptual and practical differences between treatment and prevention trials and the importance of identifying groups at high short-term risk for major depressive episodes to make prevention trials feasible. We also list the randomized controlled prevention trials that have been carried out to date and discuss the need for prevention interventions that go beyond the limits of traditional face-to-face interventions.","psychology"
"Despite their enormous potential impact on population health and health inequities, police violence and use of excessive force have only recently been addressed from a public health perspective. Moving to change this state of affairs, this article considers police violence in the USA within a social determinants and health disparities framework, highlighting recent literature linking this exposure to mental health symptoms, physical health conditions, and premature mortality. The review demonstrates that police violence is common in the USA; is disproportionately directed toward Black, Latinx, and other marginalized communities; and exerts a significant and adverse effect on a broad range of health outcomes. The state-sponsored nature of police violence, its embedding within a historical and contemporary context of structural racism, and the unique circumstances of the exposure itself make it an especially salient and impactful form of violence exposure, both overlapping with and distinct from other forms of violence. We conclude by noting potential solutions that clinical psychology and allied fields may offer toalleviate the impact of police violence, while simultaneously recognizing that a true solution to this issue requires a drastic reformation or replacement of the criminal justice system, as well as addressing the broader context of structural and systemic racism in the USA.","psychology"
"The theory of constructed emotion is a systems neuroscience approach to understanding the nature of emotion. It is also a general theoretical framework to guide hypothesis generation for how actions and experiences are constructed as the brain continually anticipates metabolic needs and attempts to meet those needs before they arise (termed allostasis). In this review, we introduce this framework and hypothesize that allostatic dysregulation is a trans-disorder vulnerability for mental and physical illness. We then review published findings consistent with the hypothesis that several symptoms in major depressive disorder (MDD), such as fatigue, distress, context insensitivity, reward insensitivity, and motor retardation, are associated with persistent problems in energy regulation. Our approach transforms the current understanding of MDD as resulting from enhanced emotional reactivity combined with reduced cognitive control and, in doing so, offers novel hypotheses regarding the development, progression, treatment, and prevention of MDD.","psychology"
"This article highlights the invisible power those in racial and gendered privilege continue to hold in the contemporary United States and the harmful psychological effects of this power on both those it oppresses and, importantly, those who wield it. A lack of empathy and an inability for compassion arise in individuals holding sociopolitical and cultural power, and we highlight how this psychological condition is qualifiable as psychosis and question why it has not been discussed as such in the literature until now. We also, however, bring attention to the invisible psychological power that marginalized populations in the United States hold, invisible because it has been left largely unrecognized by mainstream cultural forces. By centering the ways American cultural minorities successfully navigate multiply oppressive structural systems, we conclude with a reflection on how intersectional feminism can offer a philosophical lens through which to mitigate the unhealthy developmental outcomes and effects of White heteronormative male power.","psychology"
"A basic survival need is the ability to respond to, and persevere in the midst of, experiential challenges. Mechanisms of neuroplasticity permit this responsivity via functional adaptations (flexibility), as well as more substantial structural modifications following chronic stress or injury. This review focuses on prefrontally based flexibility, expressed throughout large-scale neuronal networks through the actions of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters and neuromodulators. With substance use disorders and stress-related internalizing disorders as exemplars, we review human behavioral and neuroimaging data, considering whether executive control, particularly cognitive flexibility, is impaired premorbidly, enduringly compromised with illness progression, or both. We conclude that deviations in control processes are consistently expressed in the context of active illness but operate through different mechanisms and with distinct longitudinal patterns in externalizing versus internalizing conditions.","psychology"
"Data on the efficacy and safety of psychiatric medicines should form the foundation of evidence-based treatment practices. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviews such data in determining whether to approve new treatments, and the published literature serves as a repository for evidence on treatment benefits and harms. We describe the FDA review of clinical trials, examining the underlying logic and legal guidelines. Several FDA reviews provide evidence that the agency requires only minimal efficacy for psychiatric drugs. Further, in some instances, the FDA has relied on secondary rather than primary outcomes and has discounted the findings of negative studies in its review of antidepressant and antipsychotic medications. The published literature provides another lens into the safety and efficacy of treatments. We describe how treatment efficacy is systematically overstated and treatment-related harms are understated in the scientific literature. Suggestions are provided to improve public access to underlying safety and efficacy data and for the FDA to potentially improve its review process.","psychology"
"Interventions often involve a sequence of decisions. For example, clinicians frequently adapt the intervention to an individual's outcomes. Altering the intensity and type of intervention over time is crucial for many reasons, such as to obtain improvement if the individual is not responding or to reduce costs and burden when intensive treatment is no longer necessary. Adaptive interventions utilize individual variables (severity, preferences) to adapt the intervention and then dynamically utilize individual outcomes (response to treatment, adherence) to readapt the intervention. The Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART) provides high-quality data that can be used to construct adaptive interventions. We review the SMART and highlight its advantages in constructing and revising adaptive interventions as compared to alternative experimental designs. Selected examples of SMART studies are described and compared. A data analysis method is provided and illustrated using data from the Extending Treatment Effectiveness of Naltrexone SMART study.","psychology"
"Racial stress and racial trauma refer to psychological, physiological, and behavioral responses to race-based threats and discriminatory experiences. This article reviews the evidence base regarding techniques for coping with racial stress and trauma. These techniques include self-care, self-compassion, social support, mindfulness, cognitive restructuring, cognitive defusion, identity-affirming practices and development of racial/ethnic identity, expressive writing, social action and activism, and psychedelics. These strategies have shown the potential to mitigate psychological symptoms and foster a sense of empowerment among individuals affected by racial stress and trauma. While the ultimate goal should undoubtedly be to address the root cause of racism, it is imperative to acknowledge that until then, implementing these strategies can effectively provide much-needed support for individuals affected by racism.","psychology"
"Research indicates that sexual orientation change efforts (SOCEs) are not effective and furthermore commonly lead to iatrogenic effects such as depression, anxiety, and even suicide. Negative attitudes toward homosexuality derive from most formal religions and are incarnated in medical and psychological theories that support and encourage SOCEs. Oppression of sexual minorities makes it unlikely that change requests by patients are voluntary. Recently there has been a dramatic change as the field moves from reparative to affirmative approaches. Here, we review the history of SOCEs, their consequences, current affirmative treatments, and future directions in the field as they pertain to the well-being of the queer community. From an institutional community psychology perspective, we argue that even if true conversion were possible, such efforts are unethical and should not be pursued even if requested. As is the case with all psychological/psychiatric interventions, the issue is not “can” but “ought.”","psychology"
"Depression is an eminently treatable disorder that responds to psychotherapy or medications; the efficacy of each has been established in hundreds of controlled trials. Nonetheless, the prevalence of depression has increased in recent years despite the existence of efficacious treatments—a phenomenon known as the treatment–prevalence paradox. We consider several possible explanations for this paradox, which range from a misunderstanding of the very nature of depression, inflated efficacy of the established treatments, and a lack of access to efficacious delivery of treatments. We find support for each of these possible explanations but especially the notion that large segments of the population lack access to efficacious treatments that are implemented as intended. We conclude by describing the potential of using lay therapists and digital technologies to overcome this lack of access and to reach historically underserved populations and simultaneously guarantee the quality of the interventions delivered.","psychology"
"Throughout time, ethnoracial groups have endured a range of traumatic experiences as historically marginalized members of the United States. The consequences of these experiences have been referred to as historical trauma (HT): a collective trauma, inflicted on a group of people who share a specific identity, that has psychological, physical, and social impacts on succeeding generations. In this review, we examine the literature on HT in relation to US ethnoracial groups by defining HT, providing a background for its development, and describing critiques of the concept. We then review the literature on HT in relation to Indigenous Americans, African Americans, and Asian Americans. For each group, we address the nature of HT, the transmission of HT and its impacts, and healing strategies. We conclude with a summary of the benefits, limitations, and complexities of HT research as well as recommendations for future work in this area.","psychology"
"Climate change negatively threatens mental health through acute, chronic, indirect, and vicarious pathways. Though these psychological consequences will be felt globally, specific populations are at increased risk. This article describes the complex and diverse ways in which climate change can affect mental health and the resulting challenges that health care services will inevitably face. In responding to these threats, both prevention and intervention are urgently needed. Although mitigating the extent of climate change is crucial, we can also foster resilience to climate change—the ability to manage, respond to, and prepare for climate-related adversity—at the systemic, community, and individual levels. The mental health field must prepare for the significant burden that climate change will place on population health and well-being in the long term. In this review, we aim to inform and provide examples of how decision makers, the mental health discipline, and mental health professionals can respond.","psychology"
"Schizophrenia and autism have been linked since their earliest descriptions. Both are disorders of cerebral specialization originating in the embryonic period. Genetic, molecular, and cytologic research highlights a variety of shared contributory mechanisms that may lead to patterns of abnormal connectivity arising from altered development and topology. Overt behavioral pathology likely emerges during or after neurosensitive periods in which resource demands overwhelm system resources and the individual's ability to compensate using interregional activation fails. We are at the threshold of being able to chart autism and schizophrenia from the inside out. In so doing, the door is opened to the consideration of new therapeutics that are developed based upon molecular, synaptic, and systems targets common to both disorders.","psychology"
"Exposure-based treatments for clinical anxiety generally are very effective, but relapse is not uncommon. Likewise, laboratory studies have shown that conditioned fears are easy to extinguish, but they recover easily. This analogy is striking, and numerous fear extinction studies have been published that highlight the processes responsible for the extinction and return of acquired fears. This review examines and integrates the most important results from animal and human work. Overall, the results suggest that fear extinction is relatively easy to “learn” but difficult to “remember.” It follows that treatments will benefit from an enhanced focus on the long-term retrieval of fear extinction. We review the available studies on the prevention of return of fear and the prospects of weakening fear memories forever. We show that the behavioral principles outlined in learning theory provide a continuous inspiration for preclinical (neurobiological) and clinical research on the extinction and return of fear.","psychology"
"This review addresses three questions regarding the relationships among gender, emotion regulation, and psychopathology: (a) are there gender differences in emotion regulation strategies, (b) are emotion regulation strategies similarly related to psychopathology in men and women, and (c) do gender differences in emotion regulation strategies account for gender differences in psychopathology? Women report using most emotion regulation strategies more than men do, and emotion regulation strategies are similarly related to psychopathology in women and men. More rumination in women compared to men partially accounts for greater depression and anxiety in women compared to men, while a greater tendency to use alcohol to cope partially accounts for more alcohol misuse in men compared to women. The literature on emotion regulation is likely missing vital information on how men regulate their emotions. I discuss lessons learned and questions raised about the relationships between gender differences in emotion regulation and gender differences in psychopathology.","psychology"
"In this review, we focus on two major influences on current conceptualizations of psychopathy: one clinical, with its origins largely in the early case studies of Cleckley, and the other empirical, the result of widespread use of the Hare Psychopathy Checklist-Revised (PCL-R) for assessment purposes. Some investigators assert that the PCL-R, ostensibly based on Cleckley's work, has “drifted” from the construct described in his Clinical Profile. We evaluate this profile, note its basis in an unrepresentative sample of patients, and suggest that its literal and uncritical acceptance by the research community has become problematical. We also argue that the idea of construct “drift” is irrelevant to current conceptualizations of psychopathy, which are better informed by the extensive empirical research on the integration of structural, genetic, developmental, personality, and neurobiological research findings than by rigid adherence to early clinical formulations. We offer some suggestions for future research on psychopathy.","psychology"
"As high-profile reviews have appeared and international interest has grown, sophisticated studies of the U.S. population continue to document racial and ethnic disparities in initiation of mental health care and in continuity of care. Many explanations focus on cultural factors: trust and treatment receptiveness, stigma, culturally distinctive beliefs about mental illness and mental health, culturally sanctioned ways of expressing mental health–related suffering and coping styles, and client preferences for alternative interventions and treatment-seeking pathways, as well as unresponsive programs and providers. The research itself has become more rigorous and informative, but it continues to lack theoretical focus and does not yet yield cumulative findings. Too few studies have addressed community and regional differences or differences between mental health treatment programs and systems, or considered mental health-related policies that are very likely linked to disparities. Theoretically well-formulated studies on representative samples can provide a comprehensive explanation of access disparities in cultural and culture-related terms that inform a broad-based plan of remedial intervention.","psychology"
"Machine learning approaches for clinical psychology and psychiatry explicitly focus on learning statistical functions from multidimensional data sets to make generalizable predictions about individuals. The goal of this review is to provide an accessible understanding of why this approach is important for future practice given its potential to augment decisions associated with the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of people suffering from mental illness using clinical and biological data. To this end, the limitations of current statistical paradigms in mental health research are critiqued, and an introduction is provided to critical machine learning methods used in clinical studies. A selective literature review is then presented aiming to reinforce the usefulness of machine learning methods and provide evidence of their potential. In the context of promising initial results, the current limitations of machine learning approaches are addressed, and considerations for future clinical translation are outlined.","psychology"
"This article reviews the interactions of estrogen changes and psychosocial stress in contributing to vulnerability to major depressive disorder (MDD) in women. Estrogen modulates brain networks and processes related to changes in stress response, cognition, and emotional dysregulation that are core characteristics of MDD. Synergistic effects of estrogen on cognitive and emotional function, particularly during psychosocial stress, may underlie the association of ovarian hormone fluctuation and depression in women. We propose a model of estrogen effects on multiple brain systems that interface with stress-related emotional and cognitive processes implicated in MDD and discuss possible mechanisms through which reproductive events and changes in estrogen may contribute to MDD risk in women with other concurrent risk factors.","psychology"
"Event-related potentials (ERPs) are direct measures of brain activity that can be leveraged for clinically meaningful research. They can relate robustly both to continuous measures of individual difference and to categorical diagnoses in ways that clarify similarities and distinctions between apparently related disorders and traits. ERPs can be linked to genetic risk, can act as moderators of developmental trajectories and responses to stress, and can be leveraged to identify those at greater risk for psychopathology, especially when used in combination with other neural and self-report measures. ERPs can inform models of the development of, and risk for, psychopathology. Finally, ERPs can be used as targets for existing and novel interventions and prevention efforts. We provide concrete examples for each of these possibilities by focusing on programmatic research on the error-related negativity and anxiety, and thus show that ERPs are poised to make greater contributions toward the identification, prediction, treatment, and prevention of mental disorders.","psychology"
"Postpartum depression (PPD) adversely affects the health and well being of many new mothers, their infants, and their families. A comprehensive understanding of biopsychosocial precursors to PPD is needed to solidify the current evidence base for best practices in translation. We conducted a systematic review of research published from 2000 through 2013 on biological and psychosocial factors associated with PPD and postpartum depressive symptoms. Two hundred fourteen publications based on 199 investigations of 151,651 women in the first postpartum year met inclusion criteria. The biological and psychosocial literatures are largely distinct, and few studies provide integrative analyses. The strongest PPD risk predictors among biological processes are hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal dysregulation, inflammatory processes, and genetic vulnerabilities. Among psychosocial factors, the strongest predictors are severe life events, some forms of chronic strain, relationship quality, and support from partner and mother. Fully integrated biopsychosocial investigations with large samples are needed to advance our knowledge of PPD etiology.","psychology"
"The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) was created in 1952 by the American Psychiatric Association so that mental health professionals in the United States would have a common language to use when diagnosing individuals with mental disorders. Since the initial publication of the DSM, there have been five subsequent editions of this manual published (including the DSM-III-R). This review discusses the structural changes in the six editions and the research that influenced those changes. Research is classified into three domains: (a) issues related to the DSMs as measurement systems, (b) studies of clinicians and how clinicians form diagnoses, and (c) taxonomic issues involving the philosophy of science and metatheoretical ideas about how classification systems function. The review ends with recommendations about future efforts to revise the DSMs.","psychology"
"The American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders provides the authoritative list of what are considered to be mental disorders. This list has a tremendous impact on research, funding, and treatment, as well as a variety of civil and forensic decisions. The development of this diagnostic manual is an enormous responsibility. Provided herein are lessons learned during the course of the development of the fourth edition. Noted in particular is the importance of obtaining and publishing critical reviews, restraining the unbridled creativity of experts, conducting field trials that address key issues and concerns, and conducting forthright risk-benefit analyses. It is suggested that future editions of the diagnostic manual be developed under the auspices of the Institute of Medicine. The goal would be broad representation, an evidence-based approach, disinterested recommendations, and a careful attention to the risks and benefits of each suggestion for change to the individual patient, to public policy, and to forensic applications.","psychology"
"The prevalence of obesity is growing at an alarming rate. Thus, investigation into the etiology, comorbidities, and treatment of obesity has burgeoned in recent years. While novel therapies—both behavioral and pharmacological—have been developed and tested, the mean weight losses achieved with nonsurgical approaches have remained virtually unchanged over the past 20 years. Fortunately, the modest weight losses achieved with these methods are associated with significant reductions in obesity-related health problems. With the most intensive available treatment (i.e., bariatric surgery), many patients achieve remission of comorbid conditions. This article defines obesity and provides an overview of the disease conditions associated with excess weight. Treatment options and outcomes are reviewed and future steps—including efforts to prevent obesity—are identified. Finally, the literature on the relationship between obesity and depression is examined.","psychology"
"Child maltreatment exemplifies a toxic relational environment that poses significant risks for maladaptation across biological and psychological domains of development. Research on child maltreatment can inform developmental theory, but more importantly, it can enhance the quality of clinical, legal, and policy-making decisions for maltreated children. This chapter addresses definitional, epidemiological, and etiological aspects of child maltreatment. A developmental psychopathology perspective is directed toward the discussion of the psychological and neurobiological sequelae of child maltreatment. Implications for prevention, intervention, and social policy are discussed, and recommendations for future research are proffered.","psychology"
"After a distinctly punitive era, a period of remarkable reform in juvenile crime regulation has begun. Practical urgency has fueled interest in both crime reduction and research on the prediction and malleability of criminal behavior. In this rapidly changing context, high-risk juveniles—the small proportion of the population where crime becomes concentrated—present a conundrum. Research indicates that these are precisely the individuals to treat intensively to maximize crime reduction, but there are both real and imagined barriers to doing so. Mitigation principles (during early adolescence, ages 10–13) and institutional placement or criminal court processing (during mid-late adolescence, ages 14–18) can prevent these juveniles from receiving interventions that would best protect public safety. In this review, we synthesize relevant research to help resolve this challenge in a manner that is consistent with the law's core principles. In our view, early adolescence offers unique opportunities for risk reduction that could (with modifications) be realized in the juvenile justice system in cooperation with other social institutions.","psychology"
"Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) are intended to improve mental, behavioral, and physical health by promoting clinical practices that are based on the best available evidence. The American Psychological Association (APA) is committed to generating patient-focused CPGs that are scientifically sound, clinically useful, and informative for psychologists, other health professionals, training programs, policy makers, and the public. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) 2011 standards for generating CPGs represent current best practices in the field. These standards involve multidisciplinary guideline development panels charged with generating recommendations based on comprehensive systematic reviews of the evidence. The IOM standards will guide the APA as it generates CPGs that can be used to inform the general public and the practice community regarding the benefits and harms of various treatment options. CPG recommendations are advisory rather than compulsory. When used appropriately, high-quality guidelines can facilitate shared decision making and identify gaps in knowledge.","psychology"
"Lifespan perspectives have played a crucial role in shaping our understanding of many forms of psychopathology. Unfortunately, little attention has been given to personality disorders in middle adulthood and later life. Several issues are responsible for this deficiency, including difficulty applying the diagnostic criteria for personality disorders to older people and challenges in identifying appropriate samples of older participants. The goal of this review is to explore the benefits of considering older adults in the study of personality disorders. Later life offers a unique opportunity for investigators to consider links between personality pathology and consequential outcomes in people's lives. Many domains are relevant, including health, longevity, social adjustment, marital relationships, and the experience of major life events. We review each domain and consider ways in which the study of middle-aged and older adults challenges researchers to evaluate how personality disorders in general are defined and measured.","psychology"
"This chapter provides a review of recent empirical developments, current controversies, and areas in need of further research in relation to factors that are common as well as specific to the etiology and maintenance of panic disorder, phobias, and generalized anxiety disorder. The relative contribution of broad risk factors to these disorders is discussed, including temperament, genetics, biological influences, cognition, and familial variables. In addition, the role that specific learning experiences play in relation to each disorder is reviewed. In an overarching hierarchical model, it is proposed that generalized anxiety disorder, and to some extent panic disorder, loads most heavily on broad underlying factors, whereas specific life history contributes most strongly to circumscribed phobias.","psychology"
"The goal of this review is to provide an overview of biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD), with emphasis on neuroimaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers. We first review biomarker changes in patients with late-onset AD, including findings from studies using structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), advanced MRI techniques (diffusion tensor imaging, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, perfusion), positron emission tomography with fluorodeoxyglucose, amyloid tracers, and other neurochemical tracers, and CSF protein levels. Next, we evaluate findings from these biomarkers in preclinical and prodromal stages of AD including mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and pre-MCI conditions conferring elevated risk. We then discuss related findings in patients with dominantly inherited AD. We conclude with a discussion of the current theoretical framework for the role of biomarkers in AD and emergent directions for AD biomarker research.","psychology"
"Research findings strongly suggest that cognitive behavioral therapy for the eating disorders (CBT-ED) is more effective than other treatments for bulimia nervosa (BN) and for binge eating disorder (BED), although interpersonal psychotherapy appears to be equally effective for BED. Evidence for the effectiveness of CBT-ED for the persistent (adult) form of anorexia nervosa (AN) is insufficient at present and is essentially absent for AN in adolescents except for some evidence from uncontrolled trials. This article begins with an overview of the early studies in the development of CBT-ED that showed a similar effectiveness of other symptom-focused psychotherapies—a finding that was neglected at the time. Later developments are then considered, including comparisons of CBT-ED with other psychotherapies, efforts to develop Internet-based training and treatment, and electronic applications for treatment. Finally, implications of the findings for future short- and long-term research and for clinical practice are considered.","psychology"
"Disturbances in aspects of memory described in current learning and cognitive theories are much more strongly associated with the presence of psychiatric disorder than with mere exposure to traumatic events. In posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), there are numerous associated changes that involve memory capacity, the content of memories for trauma, and a variety of memory processes. Whereas some changes appear to reflect the effects of the disorder, other evidence supports a predictive or causal role for memory disturbance. The following aspects of memory are likely to play a causal role in the development or maintenance of PTSD: verbal memory deficits, negative conceptual knowledge concerning the self, overgeneral memory, avoidance or suppression of memories, and negative interpretation of memory symptoms. Other aspects of memory likely to play a causal role that are in addition specific to PTSD are the integration of the trauma with identity, impairment in retrieval of voluntary trauma memories, and increased incidence of sensation-based memories or flashbacks.","psychology"
"Since at least the middle of the past century, one overarching model of psychiatric classification has reigned supreme, namely, that of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders and the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (herein referred to as DSM-ICD). This DSM-ICD approach embraces an Aristotelian view of mental disorders as largely discrete entities that are characterized by distinctive signs, symptoms, and natural histories. Over the past several years, however, a competing vision, namely, the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative launched by the National Institute of Mental Health, has emerged in response to accumulating anomalies within the DSM-ICD system. In contrast to DSM-ICD, RDoC embraces a Galilean view of psychopathology as the product of dysfunctions in neural circuitry. RDoC appears to be a valuable endeavor that holds out the long-term promise of an alternative system of mental illness classification. We delineate three sets of pressing challenges—conceptual, methodological, and logistical/pragmatic—that must be addressed for RDoC to realize its scientific potential. We conclude with a call for further research, including investigation of a rapprochement between Aristotelian and Galilean approaches to psychiatric classification.","psychology"
"Meta-analytic, population cohort, prospective, and clinical studies provide systematic evidence that child sexual abuse accounts for unique variation in several deleterious outcomes. There is strong evidence for psychiatric disorders, including posttraumatic stress disorder and mood, anxiety, and substance use disorders, and mixed evidence for personality disorders. Evaluation of sex-specific outcomes shows strong evidence for teenage childbearing, sexual revictimization, and sexual dysfunction and mixed evidence for heightened sexual behaviors and sexual offending. This review further demonstrates not only that survivors suffer the noxious impact of traumatic sexualization but that additional transdiagnostic mechanisms, including the biological embedding of stress, emotion dysregulation, avoidance, and insecure attachment, converge to compound risk for deleterious outcomes. A road map to enhance the rigor of future research is outlined, and specific recommendations for evidence-based policy making to boost prevention efforts and increase access to treatment are discussed.","psychology"
"Latinx immigrant families are greatly impacted by US policies and practices that limit immigrant families’ and children's rights. This article reviews the effects of such policies and the growing literature examining migration experiences. Latinx immigrant youth and parents may encounter multiple stressors across the stages of migration, including physical and structural violence, fear, poverty, and discrimination, which contribute to higher rates of mental health problems in this population. Despite significant trauma exposure, immigrants demonstrate incredible resilience within themselves, their families, and their communities and through movements and policies aimed at protecting their rights. Numerous culturally relevant universal, targeted, and intensive interventions were developed to magnify these protective factors to promote healing, advance immigration reform, and provide trauma-informed training and psychoeducation. Psychologistsplay a crucial role in implementing, evaluating, and advocating for accessible and collaborative approaches to care so that Latinx immigrant families have the resources to combat the harmful sequelae of immigration stress.","psychology"
"Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is often referred to as the “gold standard” treatment for mental health problems, given the large body of evidence supporting its efficacy. However, there are persistent questions about the generalizability of CBTs to culturally diverse populations and whether culturally sensitive approaches are warranted. In this review, we synthesize the literature on CBT for ethnic minorities, with an emphasis on randomized trials that address cultural sensitivity within the context of CBT. In general, we find that CBT is effective for ethnic minorities with diverse mental health problems, although nonsignificant trends suggest that CBT effects may be somewhat weaker for ethnic minorities compared to Whites. We find mixed support for the cultural adaptation of CBTs, but evidence for cultural sensitivity training of CBT clinicians is lacking, given a dearth of relevant trials. Based on the limited evidence thus far, we summarize three broad models for addressing cultural issues when providing CBT to diverse populations.","psychology"
"Our distant forebears wrestled with concepts of alcohol addiction not unlike those of today: Is addiction a sin or a disease? Is addiction caused by the gods, the substance, the individual's vulnerability, or psychological or social factors? Luther, Calvin, and Catholic Church leaders viewed moderate alcohol use as God's gift; used intemperately, it was a moral transgression. The founders of modern scientific psychiatry rejected moral explanations for addiction in favor of an early biological model. The first two versions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-I and DSM-II) stigmatized addiction by listing it with other societally disapproved disorders stemming from personality disorder. DSM-III espoused atheoretical, descriptive diagnoses but required tolerance or withdrawal to diagnose dependence. Substance dependence in DSM-III-R included physiological and behavioral symptoms and reflected the substance dependence syndrome. DSM-IV's emphasis on biology in its concept of dependence was unchanged from its immediate predecessors. DSM-5 declared that all drugs taken in excess have in common the direct activation of the brain reward system. This article examines evolving concepts of alcohol addiction through 12,000 years of recorded human history, from the first mention of alcohol consumption in China more than 12,000 years ago to alcohol use and abuse in the DSM era, 1952 to the present.","psychology"
"Researchers use multiple informants' reports to assess and examine behavior. However, informants' reports commonly disagree. Informants' reports often disagree in their perceived levels of a behavior (“low” versus “elevated” mood), and examining multiple reports in a single study often results in inconsistent findings. Although researchers often espouse taking a multi-informant assessment approach, they frequently address informant discrepancies using techniques that treat discrepancies as measurement error. Yet, recent work indicates that researchers in a variety of fields often may be unable to justify treating informant discrepancies as measurement error. In this review, the authors advance a framework (Operations Triad Model) outlining general principles for using and interpreting informants' reports. Using the framework, researchers can test whether or not they can extract meaningful information about behavior from discrepancies among multiple informants' reports. The authors provide supportive evidence for this framework and discuss its implications for hypothesis testing, study design, and quantitative review.","psychology"
"Why does prenatal exposure to wars, natural disasters, urbanicity, or winter increase the risk for schizophrenia? Research from the last two decades has provided rich insight about the underlying chains of causation at play during environmental upheaval, from conception to early infancy. In this review, we appraise the evidence linking schizophrenia spectrum disorder to prenatal maternal stress, obstetric complications, early infections, and maternal nutrition and other lifestyle factors. We discuss putative mechanisms, including the maternal stress system, perinatal hypoxia, and maternal–offspring immune activation. We propose that gene–environment interactions, timing during development, and sex differentiate the neuropsychiatric outcomes. Future research should pursue the translation of animal studies to humans and the longitudinal associations between early exposures, intermediate phenotypes, and psychiatric disorders. Finally, to paint a comprehensive model of risk and to harness targets for prevention, we argue that risk factors should be situated within the individual's personal ecosystem.","psychology"
"After sketching how my own interest and research into bullying problems began, I address a number of potentially controversial issues related to the definition and measurement of such problems. The importance of maintaining the distinctions between bullying victimization and general victimization and between bullying perpetration and general aggression is strongly emphasized. There are particular problems with the common method of peer nominations for purposes of prevalence estimation, comparisons of such estimates and mean levels across groups and time, and measurement of change. Two large-scale projects with time series data show that several recent claims about cyber bullying made in the media and by some researchers are greatly exaggerated and lack scientific support. Recent meta-analyses of the long-term outcomes for former bullies and victims provide convincing evidence that being involved in such problems is not just a harmless and passing school problem but something that has serious adjustment and public health consequences that also entail great costs to society. Another section presents my view of why the theme of bullying took quite some time to reach the peer relations research community in the United States and the role of a dominant research tradition focusing on “likeability” in this account. In a final section, I summarize some reasons why it may be considered important and interesting to focus both research and intervention on bully/victim problems.","psychology"
"In this review, we examine studies that use item response theory (IRT) to explore the psychometric properties of clinical measures. Next, we consider how IRT has been used in clinical research for: scale linking, computerized adaptive testing, and differential item functioning analysis. Finally, we consider the scale properties of IRT trait scores. We conclude that there are notable differences between cognitive and clinical measures that have relevance for IRT modeling. Future research should be directed toward a better understanding of the metric of the latent trait and the psychological processes that lead to individual differences in item response behaviors.","psychology"
"The fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) changed the term “somatoform disorders” to “somatic symptom and related disorders” and further modified diagnostic labels and criteria. We review evidence for the validity of the new criteria, specifically of somatic symptom disorder (SSD), and present a critical discussion of unsolved and new problems. We also provide an update of mechanisms and interventions that have been empirically evaluated in somatoform disorders. For many mechanisms, it is unclear whether their role can be easily transposed to SSD. Therefore more research is needed on the similarities and differences between medically unexplained and medically explained conditions. To overcome the obvious shortcomings of the current classification, we offer a modification of this DSM-5 section as well as a crossover system to apply these criteria for somatic symptom and related disorders. This proposal allows working with DSM-5 but also continuing successful lines of research with concepts such as hypochondriasis/illness anxiety, chronic pain, and medically unexplained versus medically explained syndromes.","psychology"
"Evidence-based assessment (EBA) emphasizes the use of research and theory to inform the selection of assessment targets, the methods and measures used in the assessment, and the assessment process itself. Our review focuses on efforts to develop and promote EBA within clinical psychology. We begin by highlighting some weaknesses in current assessment practices and then present recent efforts to develop EBA guidelines for commonly encountered clinical conditions. Next, we address the need to attend to several critical factors in developing such guidelines, including defining psychometric adequacy, ensuring appropriate attention is paid to the influence of comorbidity and diversity, and disseminating accurate and up-to-date information on EBAs. Examples are provided of how data on incremental validity and clinical utility can inform EBA. Given the central role that assessment should play in evidence-based practice, there is a pressing need for clinically relevant research that can inform EBAs.","psychology"
"Expressed emotion (EE) is a measure of the family environment that predicts worse clinical outcomes for patients with a range of disorders. This article describes the assessment of EE and the evidence linking EE to clinical relapse in patients with psychopathology. This is followed by consideration of the possible explanatory models that might account for the EE-relapse link and a review of the evidence suggesting that EE may play a causal role in the relapse process. The results of studies describing the effect of EE on patients, as well as cross-cultural aspects of the construct, are highlighted. Finally, the possibility that high levels of EE may stress patients by perturbing activity in neural circuits that underlie psychopathology is considered and new directions for EE research are outlined.","psychology"
"As the numbers of older adults continue to increase globally, the need for facilitating healthy aging has become critical. While a physically healthy lifestyle, including exercise and diet, is important, recent research has highlighted a major impact of psychosocial determinants of health, such as resilience, wisdom, positive social connections, and mental well-being, on whole health. This article focuses on keeping the mind and brain healthy with psychosocially active aging. It has six sections: Philosophy Concepts of Wisdom, Resilience, and Well-Being; Wisdom: Clinical, Neurobiological, and Evolutionary Perspectives; Resilience, Adaptation, and Augmentation; Psychological Resilience, Brain Health, and Whole Person Health; Preventing Depression and Promoting Resilience and Well-Being in Old Age; and The Centenarian as a Model of Resilience and Well-Being. We discuss the biopsychosocial mechanisms and effectiveness of healthy lifestyle strategies and propose a framework for future research and its practical implications for promoting wisdom, resilience, and well-being at the individual, societal, and policy levels.","psychology"
"This review updates and extends Gone &amp; Trimble's (2012) prior review of American Indian (AI) and Alaska Native (AN) mental health. First, it defines AI/AN populations in the USA, with an explanation of the importance of political citizenship in semisovereign Tribal Nations as primary for categorizing this population. Second, it presents an updated summary of what is known about AI/AN mental health, with careful notation of recurrent findings concerning community inequities in addiction, trauma, and suicide. Third, this article reviews key literature about AI/AN community mental health services appearing since 2010, including six randomized controlled trials of recognizable mental health treatments. Finally, it reimagines the AI/AN mental health enterprise in response to an “alter-Native psy-ence,” which recasts prevalent mental health conditions as postcolonial pathologies and harnesses postcolonial meaning-making through Indigenized therapeutic interventions. Ultimately, AI/AN Tribal Nations must determine for themselves how to adopt, adapt, integrate, or refuse specific mental health treatments and services for wider community benefit.","psychology"
"For many people worldwide, supernatural beliefs and attributions—those focused on God, the devil, demons, spirits, an afterlife, karma, or fate—are part of everyday life. Although not widely studied in clinical psychology, these beliefs and attributions are a key part of human diversity. This article provides a broad overview of research on supernatural beliefs and attributions with special attention to their psychological relevance: They can serve as coping resources, sources of distress, psychopathology signals, moral guides, and decision-making tools. Although supernatural attributions sometimes involve dramatic experiences seen to violate natural laws, people more commonly think of supernatural entities working indirectly through natural events. A whole host of factors can lead people to make supernatural attributions, including contextual factors, specific beliefs, psychopathology, cognitive styles and personality, and social and cultural influences. Our aim is to provide clinical psychologists with an entry point into this rich, fascinating, and often overlooked literature.","psychology"
"A review of recent research on cognitive processing indicates that biases in attention, memory, and interpretation, as well as repetitive negative thoughts, are common across emotional disorders, although they vary in form according to type of disorder. Current cognitive models emphasize specific forms of biased processing, such as variations in the focus of attention or habitual interpretative styles that contribute to the risk of developing particular disorders. As well as predicting risk of emotional disorders, new studies haveprovided evidence of a causal relationship between processing bias and vulnerability. Beyond merely demonstrating the existence of biased processing, research is thus beginning to explore the cognitive causes of emotional vulnerability, and their modification.","psychology"

"Historically, suicide rates for African American adolescents have been low, relative to rates for youth of other racial-ethnic backgrounds. Since 2001, however, suicide rates among African American adolescents have escalated: Suicide is now the third leading cause of death for African American adolescents. This disturbing trend warrants focused research on suicide etiology and manifestation in African American adolescents, along with culturally sensitive and effective prevention efforts. First, we revisit leading suicide theories and their relevance for African American adolescents. Next, we discuss health promotive and protective factors within the context of African American youth development. We also critique the current status of suicide risk assessment and prevention for African American adolescents. Then, we present a heuristic model of suicide risk and resilience for African American adolescents that considers their development within a hegemonic society. Finally, we recommend future directions for African American adolescent suicidology.","psychology"
"Mentalizing is the capacity to understand others and oneself in terms of internal mental states. It is assumed to be underpinned by four dimensions: automatic–controlled, internally–externally focused, self–other, and cognitive–affective. Research suggests that mental disorders are associated with different imbalances in these dimensions. Addressing the quality of mentalizing as part of psychosocial treatments may benefit individuals with various mental disorders. We suggest that mentalizing is a helpful transtheoretical and transdiagnostic concept to explain vulnerability to psychopathology and its treatment. This review summarizes the mentalizing approach to psychopathology from a developmental socioecological evolutionary perspective. We then focus on the application of the mentalizing approach to personality disorders, and we review studies that have extended this approach to other types of psychopathology, including depression, anxiety, and eating disorders. We summarize core principles of mentalization-based treatments and preventive interventions and the evidence for their effectiveness. We conclude with recommendations for future research.","psychology"
"Bottom-up paradigms prioritize empirical data from which to derive conceptualizations of psychopathology. These paradigms use multivariate statistics to identify syndromes of problems that tend to co-occur plus higher-order groupings such as those designated as internalizing and externalizing. Bottom-up assessment instruments obtain self-ratings and collateral ratings of behavioral, emotional, social, and thought problems and strengths for ages 1½–90+. Ratings of population samples provide norms for syndrome and higher-order scales for each gender, at different ages, rated by different informants, in relation to multicultural norms. The normed assessment instruments operationalize the empirically derived syndromes and higher-order groupings for applications to clinical services, research, and training. Because cross-informant agreement is modest and no single informant provides comprehensive assessment data, software compares ratings by different informants. Top-down paradigms prioritize conceptual representations of the nature and structure of psychopathology, as exemplified by psychodynamic, DSM/ICD, and HiTOP paradigms. Although these paradigms originated with observations, they tend to prioritize conceptual representations over empirical data.","psychology"
"Childhood conduct disorders, a serious mental health concern, put children at risk for significant mental health problems throughout development. Elevations on callous-unemotional (CU) traits designate a subgroup of youth with conduct disorders who have unique causal processes underlying their problem behavior and are at a particularly high risk for serious impairment relative to others with these disorders. As a result, these traits have recently been integrated into major diagnostic classification systems for conduct disorders. Given that CU traits are partly defined by deficits in empathy, we review research on empathy development in typically developing children and use this research to ( a) advance theories on the specific emotional deficits that may be associated with CU traits, ( b) explain the severe pattern of aggressive behavior displayed by children with elevated CU traits, and ( c) suggest possible ways to enhance prevention and treatment for children with conduct disorders and elevated CU traits.","psychology"
"Neuropsychiatric disorders are associated with abnormal function of the default mode network (DMN), a distributed network of brain regions more active during rest than during performance of many attention-demanding tasks and characterized by a high degree of functional connectivity (i.e., temporal correlations between brain regions). Functional magnetic resonance imaging studies have revealed that the DMN in the healthy brain is associated with stimulus-independent thought and self-reflection and that greater suppression of the DMN is associated with better performance on attention-demanding tasks. In schizophrenia and depression, the DMN is often found to be hyperactivated and hyperconnected. In schizophrenia this may relate to overly intensive self-reference and impairments in attention and working memory. In depression, DMN hyperactivity may be related to negative rumination. These findings are considered in terms of what is known about psychological functions supported by the DMN, and alteration of the DMN in other neuropsychiatric disorders.","psychology"
"Cognitive theories of depression posit that people's thoughts, inferences, attitudes, and interpretations, and the way in which they attend to and recall information, can increase their risk for depression. Three mechanisms have been implicated in the relation between biased cognitive processing and the dysregulation of emotion in depression: inhibitory processes and deficits in working memory, ruminative responses to negative mood states and negative life events, and the inability to use positive and rewarding stimuli to regulate negative mood. In this review, we present a contemporary characterization of depressive cognition and discuss how different cognitive processes are related not only to each other, but also to emotion dysregulation, the hallmark feature of depression. We conclude that depression is characterized by increased elaboration of negative information, by difficulties disengaging from negative material, and by deficits in cognitive control when processing negative information. We discuss treatment implications of these conclusions and argue that the study of cognitive aspects of depression must be broadened by investigating neural and genetic factors that are related to cognitive dysfunction in this disorder. Such integrative investigations should help us gain a more comprehensive understanding of how cognitive and biological factors interact to affect the onset, maintenance, and course of depression.","psychology"
"There is overwhelming evidence that sleep is crucial for memory consolidation. Patients with schizophrenia and their unaffected relatives have a specific deficit in sleep spindles, a defining oscillation of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) Stage 2 sleep that, in coordination with other NREM oscillations, mediate memory consolidation. In schizophrenia, the spindle deficit correlates with impaired sleep-dependent memory consolidation, positive symptoms, and abnormal thalamocortical connectivity. These relations point to dysfunction of the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN), which generates spindles, gates the relay of sensory information to the cortex, and modulates thalamocortical communication. Genetic studies are beginning to provide clues to possible neurodevelopmental origins of TRN-mediated thalamocortical circuit dysfunction and to identify novel targets for treating the related memory deficits and symptoms. By forging empirical links in causal chains from risk genes to thalamocortical circuit dysfunction, spindle deficits, memory impairment, symptoms, and diagnosis, future research can advance our mechanistic understanding, treatment, and prevention of schizophrenia.","psychology"
"Mindfulness meditation is increasingly incorporated into mental health interventions, and theoretical concepts associated with it have influenced basic research on psychopathology. Here, we review the current understanding of mindfulness meditation through the lens of clinical neuroscience, outlining the core capacities targeted by mindfulness meditation and mapping them onto cognitive and affective constructs of the Research Domain Criteria matrix proposed by the National Institute of Mental Health. We review efficacious applications of mindfulness meditation to specific domains of psychopathology including depression, anxiety, chronic pain, and substance abuse, as well as emerging efforts related to attention disorders, traumatic stress, dysregulated eating, and serious mental illness. Priorities for future research include pinpointing mechanisms, refining methodology, and improving implementation. Mindfulness meditation is a promising basis for interventions, with particular potential relevance to psychiatric comorbidity. The successes and challenges of mindfulness meditation research are instructive for broader interactions between contemplative traditions and clinical psychological science.","psychology"
"State-level marijuana liberalization policies have been evolving for the past five decades, and yet the overall scientific evidence of the impact of these policies is widely believed to be inconclusive. In this review we summarize some of the key limitations of the studies evaluating the effects of decriminalization and medical marijuana laws on marijuana use, highlighting their inconsistencies in terms of the heterogeneity of policies, the timing of the evaluations, and the measures of use being considered. We suggest that the heterogeneity in the responsiveness of different populations to particular laws is important for interpreting the mixed findings from the literature, and we highlight the limitations of the existing literature in providing clear insights into the probable effects of marijuana legalization.","psychology"
"I have been given a priceless opportunity to reflect on my career in the remarkably productive field of risk factors for depression. Psychological research on depression exploded in the early years of my work. I try to give an account of the choices and challenges, and reflect on the influences, some calculated and some serendipitous, that determined the paths I have followed. I focus mostly on the robust depression risk factors that have influenced my research, including dysfunctional cognitions, stressful life events and circumstances, parental depression, interpersonal dysfunction, and being female, and I cover some of what I did but also the influential work of others. This is a selective review of depression research in the past 40 or so years, noting some of the big developments that set the stage for the remarkable activity that continues today. In the conclusion, there is a brief statement of aspirations for future developments in our field.","psychology"
"Despite psychological scientists’ increasing interest in replicability, open science, research transparency, and the improvement of methods and practices, the clinical psychology community has been slow to engage. This has been shifting more recently, and with this review, we hope to facilitate this emerging dialogue. We begin by examining some potential areas of weakness in clinical psychology in terms of methods, practices, and evidentiary base. We then discuss a select overview of solutions, tools, and current concerns of the reform movement from a clinical psychological science perspective. We examine areas of clinical science expertise (e.g., implementation science) that should be leveraged to inform open science and reform efforts. Finally, we reiterate the call to clinical psychologists to increase their efforts toward reform that can further improve the credibility of clinical psychological science.","psychology"
"As president of the American Psychological Association in 1998, I organized researchers and practitioners to work on building well-being, not just on the traditional task of reducing ill-being. Substantial research then found that well-being causes many external benefits, including better physical and mental health. Among the applications of Positive Psychology are national psychological accounts of well-being, Positive Psychotherapy, the classification of strengths and virtues, Comprehensive Soldier Fitness, and Positive Education. Positive Psychology has spread beyond psychology into neuroscience, health, psychiatry, theology, and even to the humanities. Positive Psychology has many critics, and I comment on the strongest criticisms. I conclude with the hope that the building of well-being will become a cornerstone of morality, politics, and religion.","psychology"
"We review the literature on pathological narcissism and narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) and describe a significant criterion problem related to four inconsistencies in phenotypic descriptions and taxonomic models across clinical theory, research, and practice; psychiatric diagnosis; and social/personality psychology. This impedes scientific synthesis, weakens narcissism's nomological net, and contributes to a discrepancy between low prevalence rates of NPD and higher rates of practitioner-diagnosed pathological narcissism, along with an enormous clinical literature on narcissistic disturbances. Criterion issues must be resolved, including clarification of the nature of normal and pathological narcissism, incorporation of the two broad phenotypic themes of narcissistic grandiosity and narcissistic vulnerability into revised diagnostic criteria and assessment instruments, elimination of references to overt and covert narcissism that reify these modes of expression as distinct narcissistic types, and determination of the appropriate structure for pathological narcissism. Implications for the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders and the science of personality disorders are presented.","psychology"
"Suicidal behavior is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Fortunately, recent developments in suicide theory and research promise to meaningfully advance knowledge and prevention. One key development is the ideation-to-action framework, which stipulates that (a) the development of suicidal ideation and (b) the progression from ideation to suicide attempts are distinct phenomena with distinct explanations and predictors. A second key development is a growing body of research distinguishing factors that predict ideation from those that predict suicide attempts. For example, it is becoming clear that depression, hopelessness, most mental disorders, and even impulsivity predict ideation, but these factors struggle to distinguish those who have attempted suicide from those who have only considered suicide. Means restriction is also emerging as a highly effective way to block progression from ideation to attempt. A third key development is the proliferation of theories of suicide that are positioned within the ideation-to-action framework. These include the interpersonal theory, the integrated motivational-volitional model, and the three-step theory. These perspectives can and should inform the next generation of suicide research and prevention.","psychology"
"Intervention scientists have published more than 600 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of youth psychotherapies. Four decades of meta-analyses have been used to synthesize the RCT findings and identify scientifically and clinically significant patterns. These meta-analyses have limitations, noted herein, but they have advanced our understanding of youth psychotherapy, revealing (a) mental health problems for which our interventions are more and less successful (e.g., anxiety and depression, respectively); (b) the beneficial effects of single-session interventions, interventions delivered remotely, and interventions tested in low- and middle-income countries; (c) the association of societal sexism and racism with reduced treatment benefit in majority-girl and majority-Black groups; and, importantly, (d) the finding that average youth treatment benefit has not increased across five decades of research, suggesting that new strategies may be needed. Opportunities for the future include boosting relevance to policy and practice and using meta-analysis to identify mechanisms of change and guide personalizing of treatment.","psychology"
"The therapeutic onset of traditional antidepressants is delayed by several weeks and many depressed patients fail to respond to treatment altogether. In contrast, subanesthetic ketamine can rapidly alleviate symptoms of depression within hours of a single administration, even in patients who are considered treatment-resistant. Ketamine is thought to exert these effects by restoring the integrity of neural circuits that are compromised in depression. This hypothesis stems in part from preclinical observations that ketamine can strengthen synaptic connections by increasing glutamate-mediated neurotransmission and promoting rapid neurotrophic factor release. An improved understanding of how ketamine, and other novel rapid-acting antidepressants, give rise to these processes will help foster future therapeutic innovation. Here, we review the history of antidepressant treatment advances that preceded the ketamine discovery, critically examine mechanistic hypotheses for how ketamine may exert its antidepressant effects, and discuss the impact this knowledge has had on ongoing drug discovery efforts.","psychology"
"This article reviews the history of the treatment of women's sexual problems from the Victorian era to the twenty-first century. The contextual nature of determining what constitutes female sexual psychopathology is highlighted. Conceptions of normal sexuality are subject to cultural vagaries, making it difficult to identify female sexual dysfunctions. A survey of the inclusion, removal, and collapsing of women's sexual diagnoses in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders from 1952 to 2013 illuminates the biases in the various editions. Masters and Johnson's models of sexual response and dysfunction paved the way for the diagnosis and treatment of women's sexual dysfunctions. Their sex therapy paradigm is described. Conceptions of and treatments for anorgasmia, arousal difficulties, vaginismus, dyspareunia, and low desire are reviewed. The medicalization of human sexuality and the splintering of sex therapy are discussed, along with current trends and new directions in sexual health care for women.","psychology"
"The United States has substantially higher levels of firearm violence than most other developed countries. Firearm violence is a significant and preventable public health crisis. Mental illness is a weak risk factor for violence despite popular misconceptions reflected in the media and policy. That said, mental health professionals play a critical role in assessing their patients for violence risk, counseling about firearm safety, and guiding the creation of rational and evidence-based public policy that can be effective in mitigating violence risk without unnecessarily stigmatizing people with mental illness. This article summarizes existing evidence about the interplay among mental illness, violence, and firearms, with particular attention paid to the role of active symptoms, addiction, victimization, and psychosocial risk factors. The social and legal context of firearm ownership is discussed as a preface to exploring practical, evidence-driven, and behaviorally informed policy recommendations for mitigating firearm violence risk.","psychology"
"Endophenotypes for psychopathology have been conceived as latent, unobserved, but measureable manifestations of phenomena that causally connect genetic liability to clinical disorder. Several decades of research have led to refinement of the construct and identification of some candidate endophenotypes, but rather limited progress on finding the genes involved or the mechanisms by which endophenotypes are driven by genetic and environmental factors and in turn drive psychopathology. Currently promising avenues for research involve development of transdiagnostic concepts not limited to traditional diagnostic categories, measures of endophenotypic and manifest psychopathology that have higher validity than those categories, and methods for modeling complex relationships among diverse contributors to etiology. With more grounding in animal neuroscience and other aspects of basic biological and psychological science, exemplified in the Research Domain Criteria initiative, there is every reason to anticipate that the endophenotype concept will grow more central in the psychopathology literature.","psychology"
"Over the past decade, behavioral interventions have become increasingly recognized and recommended as effective first-line therapies for treating individuals with tic disorders. In this article, we describe a basic theoretical and conceptual framework through which the reader can understand the application of these interventions for treating tics. The three primary behavioral interventions for tics with the strongest empirical support (habit reversal, Comprehensive Behavioral Intervention for Tics, and exposure and response prevention) are described. Research on the efficacy and effectiveness of these treatments is summarized along with a discussion of the research evaluating the delivery of these treatments in different formats and modalities. The article closes with a review of the possible mechanisms of change underlying behavioral interventions for tics and areas for future research.","psychology"
"Around 19% of US adults smoke cigarettes, and smoking remains the leading avoidable cause of death in this country. Without treatment only ∼5% of smokers who try to quit achieve long-term abstinence, but evidence-based cessation treatment increases this figure to 10% to 30%. The process of smoking cessation comprises different pragmatically defined phases, and these can help guide smoking treatment development and evaluation. This review evaluates the effectiveness of smoking interventions for smokers who are unwilling to make a quit attempt (motivation phase), who are willing to make a quit attempt (cessation phase), who have recently quit (maintenance phase), and who have recently relapsed (relapse recovery phase). Multiple effective treatments exist for some phases (cessation), but not others (relapse recovery). A chronic care approach to treating smoking requires effective interventions for every phase, especially interventions that exert complementary effects both within and across phases and that can be disseminated broadly and cost-effectively.","psychology"
"We review the definitions, predictors, and biobehavioral determinants of successful aging, as well as the evidence for and mechanisms of underlying selected interventions to enhance cognitive and emotional health in older adults. Defining successful aging has proven difficult, with discrepancies seen among biomedical, psychological, and lay perspectives. Although consensus is lacking, a number of studies have examined the genetic, lifestyle, and social determinants of operationalized determinants of successful aging; qualitative examinations of the meaning of the construct have also been conducted. The determinants coincide with fundamental aspects of aging. Recent clinical trials suggest that caloric restriction, physical activity, cognitive intervention, stress reduction, and social programs may enhance cognitive and emotional health in older people.","psychology"
"Many opportunities to explain attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)-related risk of substance use disorder (SUD) remain available for study. We detail these opportunities by considering characteristics of children with ADHD and factors affecting their outcomes side by side with overlapping variables in the developmental literature on SUD etiology. Although serious conduct problems are a known contributor to ADHD-related risk of SUD, few studies have considered their emergence developmentally and in relation to other candidate mediators and moderators that could also explain risk and be intervention targets. Common ADHD-related impairments, such as school difficulties, are in need of research. Heterogeneous social impairments have the potential for predisposing, and buffering, influences. Research on neurocognitive domains should move beyond standard executive function batteries to measure deficits in the interface between cognitive control, reward, and motivation. Ultimately, maximizing prediction will depend, as it has in the SUD literature, on simultaneous consideration of multiple risk factors.","psychology"
"We present a revision of latent state-trait (LST-R) theory with new definitions of states and traits. This theory applies whenever we study the consistency of behavior, its variability, and its change over time. States and traits are defined in terms of probability theory. This allows for a seamless transition from theory to statistical modeling of empirical data. LST-R theory not only gives insights into the nature of latent variables but it also takes into account four fundamental facts: Observations are fallible, they never happen in a situational vacuum, they are always made using a specific method of observations, and there is no person without a past. Although the first fact necessitates considering measurement error, the second fact requires allowances for situational fluctuations. The third fact implies that, in the first place, states and traits are method specific. Furthermore, compared to the previous version of LST theory (see, e.g., Steyer et al. 1992 , 1999 ), our revision is based on the notion of a person-at-time-t. The new definitions in LST-R theory have far-reaching implications that not only concern the properties of states, traits, and the associated concepts of measurement errors and state residuals, but also are related to the analysis of states and traits in longitudinal observational and intervention studies.","psychology"
"Epidemiological studies have shown that the association between cannabis and psychosis is robust and consistent across different samples, with compelling evidence for a dose-response relationship. Because longitudinal work indicates that cannabis use precedes psychotic symptoms, it seems reasonable to assume a causal relationship. However, more work is needed to address the possibility of gene-environment correlation (for example, genetic risk for psychosis causing onset of cannabis use). Moreover, knowledge about underlying biological mechanisms linking cannabis use and psychosis is still relatively limited. In order to understand how cannabis use may lead to an increased risk for psychosis, in the present article we (a) review the epidemiological, neurobiological, and genetic evidence linking cannabinoids and psychosis, (b) assess the quality of the evidence, and finally (c) try to integrate the most robust findings into a neurodevelopmental model of cannabis-induced psychosis and identify the gaps in knowledge that are in need of further investigation.","psychology"
"Awake but not aware: This puzzling dissociation of the two central elements of consciousness defines the vegetative state. Traditionally, this condition has been believed to imply a brain with preserved hypothalamic and brainstem autonomic functions but with no capacity for cortical cognitive processes. As is discussed in this review, over a 20-year span neuroimaging techniques have clearly demonstrated that this characterization of patients in a vegetative state is incorrect. Contrary to the initial belief, the “vegetative” brain can retain several high-level aspects of cognitive functions, across sensory modalities, including language processing and learning dynamics. Nonetheless, the residual cognitive functions observed in vegetative patients might reflect intact but functionally disconnected cortical modules that do not give rise to the subjective feeling of phenomenological awareness.","psychology"
"People with emotional disorders, such as social anxiety disorder (SAD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and depression, demonstrate a consistent tendency, or bias, to generate negative interpretations of ambiguous material. This is different from people without emotional disorders who tend, in general, to make positive interpretations of ambiguity. If central components of an emotional disorder have high levels of inherent ambiguity (e.g., concern about the negative perceptions of others in SAD, or worry in GAD), then interpretive bias may have a causal maintaining role, and this has been demonstrated in studies using cognitive bias modification techniques. This research has also shown that interpretation biases combine with other cognitive processes, such as imagery and memory, which could exacerbate distress. Psychological interventions will benefit from effectively targeting negative interpretations, and future experimental research can inform ways to improve facilitation of more benign inferential processing to maximize amelioration of key components of emotional disorders.","psychology"
"The current state of the literature regarding psychosocial treatments for schizophrenia is reviewed within the frameworks of the recovery model of mental health and the expanded stress-vulnerability model. Interventions targeting specific domains of functioning, age groups, stages of illness, and human service system gaps are classified as evidence-based practices or promising practices according to the extent to which their efficacy is currently supported by meta-analyses and individual randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Evidence-based practices include assertive community treatment (ACT), cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) for psychosis, cognitive remediation, family psychoeducation, illness self-management training, social skills training, and supported employment. Promising practices include cognitive adaptive therapy, CBT for posttraumatic stress disorder, first-episode psychosis intervention, healthy lifestyle interventions, integrated treatment for co-occurring disorders, interventions targeting older individuals, peer support services, physical disease management, prodromal stage intervention, social cognition training, supported education, and supported housing. Implications and future directions are discussed.","psychology"
"Decision making is central to health policy and medical practice. Because health outcomes are probabilistic, most decisions are made under conditions of uncertainty. This review considers two classes of decisions in health care: decisions made by providers on behalf of patients, and shared decisions between patients and providers. Considerable evidence suggests wide regional variation exists in services received by patients. Evidence-based guidelines that incorporate quality of life and patient preferences may help address this problem. Systematic cost-effectiveness analysis can be used to improve resource allocation decisions. Shared medical decision making seeks to engage patients and providers in a collaborative process to choose clinical options that reflect patient preferences. Although some evidence indicates patients want an active role in making decisions, other evidence suggests that some patients prefer a passive role. Decision aids hold promise for improving individual decisions, but there are still few systematic evaluations of these aids. Several directions for future research are offered.","psychology"
"Genital pain associated with sex is a prevalent and distressing problem with a complex research and clinical profile. This article reviews the historical context of the “sexual pain disorders” and the circuitous trajectory that has led from the first mention of painful sex in ancient documents to the latest diagnostic category of genito-pelvic pain penetration disorder in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders as well as in other existing and proposed nomenclatures. Prominent etiologic research and emergent theoretical models are critically assessed, as is the latest treatment outcome research of note. Finally, the review points to a number of extant needs in the research and clinical effort, including an integrated biopsychosocial and multidisciplinary approach, randomized clinical trials, targeting of treatment barriers, and expansion of the entire enterprise to include populations that have not been considered.","psychology"
"Our article reviews and celebrates Susan Nolen-Hoeksema's remarkable contributions to psychological and clinical science, focusing on her vast body of theoretical and empirical work and her influence on colleagues and students. Susan spent her career trying to understand how and why a style of regulating emotions called rumination increases vulnerability to depression and exacerbates and perpetuates negative moods. More broadly, we describe research by Susan and her colleagues on the predictors of depression in childhood and adolescence; gender differences in depression and rumination in adolescence and adulthood; roots, correlates, and adverse consequences of ruminative response styles; and rumination as a transdiagnostic risk factor for not only depression but also a host of psychological disorders, including anxiety, substance abuse, and eating disorders. Susan's intellectual legacy is evident in her impressive publication and citation record, the clinical applications of her work, and the flourishing careers of the students she mentored.","psychology"
"Alcohol use is often part of the fabric of marriage and family life, and although it is associated with certain positive effects, excessive drinking and alcohol disorders can exert a negative effect on the marital development and on the development of children in the context of the family. This review considers evidence that alcohol influences and is influenced by marital/family processes, including transitions into marriage and parenthood, marital satisfaction, marital violence, parenting, and child development. The review discusses the importance of antisocial behavior and the need to examine women's drinking, and the joint impact of men's and women's drinking on marital/family processes. The review highlights the lack of studies in certain key areas, including the link between discordant drinking and violence and marital satisfaction, the role of alcohol in child neglect, and the potential role of marital conflict as a mediator or moderator of the relationship between alcohol and child functioning.","psychology"
"In the past 25 years, the field of HIV prevention research has been transformed repeatedly. Today, effective HIV prevention requires a combination of behavioral, biomedical, and structural intervention strategies. Risk of transmitting or acquiring HIV is reduced by consistent male- and female-condom use, reductions in concurrent and/or sequential sexual and needle-sharing partners, male circumcision, and treatment with antiretroviral medications. At least 144 behavioral prevention programs have been found effective in reducing HIV transmission acts; however, scale up of these programs has not occurred outside of the United States. A series of recent failures of HIV-prevention efficacy trials for biomedical innovations such as HIV vaccines, treating herpes simplex 2 and other sexually transmitted infections, and diaphragm and microbicide barriers highlights the need for behavioral strategies to accompany biomedical strategies. This challenges prevention researchers to reconceptualize how cost-effective, useful, realistic, and sustainable prevention programs will be designed, delivered, tested, and diffused. The next generation of HIV prevention science must draw from the successes of existing evidence-based interventions and the expertise of the market sector to integrate preventive innovations and behaviors into everyday routines.","psychology"
"Harm reduction is a pragmatic approach to reduce the harmful consequences of alcohol and drug use or other high-risk activities by incorporating several strategies that cut across the spectrum from safer use to managed use to abstinence. The primary goal of most harm-reduction approaches is to meet individuals “where they are at” and not to ignore or condemn the harmful behaviors but rather to work with the individual or community to minimize the harmful effects of a given behavior. The current review addresses some of the newest developments with respect to harm-reduction policy, prevention, and treatment. In particular, this review highlights policies and programs that have been evaluated in peer-reviewed journals and shown to be effective at reducing the harms associated with alcohol and drug use. The overall goal of this review is to present some of the most recent developments in the field of harm reduction.","psychology"
"Positive psychology is the scientific study of positive experiences and positive individual traits, and the institutions that facilitate their development. A field concerned with well-being and optimal functioning, positive psychology aims to broaden the focus of clinical psychology beyond suffering and its direct alleviation. Our proposed conceptual framework parses happiness into three domains: pleasure, engagement, and meaning. For each of these constructs, there are now valid and practical assessment tools appropriate for the clinical setting. Additionally, mounting evidence demonstrates the efficacy and effectiveness of positive interventions aimed at cultivating pleasure, engagement, and meaning. We contend that positive interventions are justifiable in their own right. Positive interventions may also usefully supplement direct attempts to prevent and treat psychopathology and, indeed, may covertly be a central component of good psychotherapy as it is done now.","psychology"
"Binge eating disorder (BED) was introduced in 1994 as a provisional eating disorder diagnosis. The core symptom is recurrent binge eating in the absence of inappropriate compensatory behaviors and/or extreme dietary restraint. This review examines the status of the literature on BED according to five criteria that have been proposed to determine whether BED warrants inclusion in the psychiatric nosology as a distinct eating disorder. We conclude that each of these criteria was met. There is a commonly accepted definition of and assessment approach to BED. The clinical utility and validity of BED have been established, and BED is distinguishable from both bulimia nervosa and obesity. BED should be included in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.","psychology"
"Disruptions in emotional, cognitive, and social behavior are common in neurodegenerative disease and in many forms of psychopathology. Because neurodegenerative diseases have patterns of brain atrophy that are much clearer than those of psychiatric disorders, they may provide a window into the neural bases of common emotional and behavioral symptoms. We discuss five common symptoms that occur in both neurodegenerative disease and psychopathology (i.e., anxiety, dysphoric mood, apathy, disinhibition, and euphoric mood) and their associated neural circuitry. We focus on two neurodegenerative diseases (i.e., Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia) that are common and well characterized in terms of emotion, cognition, and social behavior and in patterns of associated atrophy. Neurodegenerative diseases provide a powerful model system for studying the neural correlates of psychopathological symptoms; this is supported by evidence indicating convergence with psychiatric syndromes (e.g., symptoms of disinhibition associated with dysfunction in orbitofrontal cortex in both frontotemporal dementia and bipolar disorder). We conclude that neurodegenerative diseases can play an important role in future approaches to the assessment, prevention, and treatment of mental illness.","psychology"
"Depression is a significant public health problem, but its etiology and pathophysiology remain poorly understood. Such incomplete understanding likely arises from the fact that depression encompasses a heterogeneous set of disorders. To overcome these limitations, renewed interest in intermediate phenotypes (endophenotypes) has resurfaced, and anhedonia has emerged as one of the most promising endophenotypes of depression. Here, a heuristic model is presented postulating that anhedonia arises from dysfunctional interactions between stress and brain reward systems. To this end, we review and integrate three bodies of independent literature investigating the role of (a) anhedonia, (b) dopamine, and (c) stress in depression. In a fourth section, we summarize animal data indicating that stress negatively affects mesocorticolimbic dopaminergic pathways critically implicated in incentive motivation and reinforcement learning. In the last section, we provide a synthesis of these four literatures, present initial evidence consistent with our model, and discuss directions for future research.","psychology"
"The idea that adverse life circumstances and negative life events contribute to disorder and disease has long been held. Advances in conceptualizing and defining these conditions under the common label of life stress have led to progress in measuring both the environmental and individual response characteristics that may promote disorder and disease. In general, a substantial and growing research literature supports the basic premise that life stress plays an important role in the development of many psychological and physical problems. Recent research, too, strongly suggests that interest in life stress in relation to health and disease will accelerate over the coming years. Yet debates and controversies remain concerning how to best conceptualize and measure life stress, which presents distinctive challenges for advancing the field. The present review examines the major issues pertaining to these debates, controversies, and challenges, for they will be crucial to resolve if progress is to be made in understanding ways in which life stress may or may not contribute to psychological and physical disorders.","psychology"
"The results of recent community epidemiological research are reviewed, documenting that major depressive disorder (MDD) is a highly prevalent, persistent, and often seriously impairing disorder, and that bipolar disorder (BPD) is less prevalent but more persistent and more impairing than MDD. The higher persistence and severity of BPD results in a substantial proportion of all seriously impairing depressive episodes being due to threshold or subthreshold BPD rather than to MDD. Although the percentage of people with mood disorders in treatment has increased substantially since the early 1990s, a majority of cases remain either untreated or undertreated. An especially serious concern is the misdiagnosis of depressive episodes due to BPD as due to MDD because the majority of depression treatment involves medication provided by primary care doctors in the absence of psychotherapy. The article closes with a discussion of future directions for research.","psychology"
"Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) results from exposure to a traumatic event that poses actual or threatened death or injury and produces intense fear, helplessness, or horror. U.S. population surveys reveal lifetime PTSD prevalence rates of 7% to 8%. Potential reasons for varying prevalence rates across gender, cultures, and samples exposed to different traumas are discussed. Drawing upon a conditioning model of PTSD, we review risk factors for PTSD, including pre-existing individual-based factors, features of the traumatic event, and posttrauma social support. Characteristics of the trauma, particularly peritraumatic response and related cognitions, and posttrauma social support appear to confer the greatest risk for PTSD. Further work is needed to disentangle the interrelationships among these factors and elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Based upon existing treatment outcome studies, we recommend use of exposure therapies and anxiety management training as first-line treatment for PTSD. Among psychopharmacological treatments, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors evidence the strongest treatment effects, yet these effects are modest compared with psychological treatments.","psychology"
"Placebos are sham medical treatments. Nonetheless, they can have substantial effects on clinical outcomes. Placebos depend on a person's psychological and brain responses to the treatment context, which influence appraisals of future well-being. Appraisals are flexible cognitive evaluations of the personal meaning of events and situations that can directly impact symptoms and physiology. They also shape associative learning processes by guiding what is learned from experience. Appraisals are supported by a core network of brain regions associated with the default mode network involved in self-generated emotion, self-evaluation, thinking about the future, social cognition, and valuation of rewards and punishment. Placebo treatments for acute pain and a range of clinical conditions engage this same network of regions, suggesting that placebos affect behavior and physiology by changing how a person evaluates their future well-being and the personal significance of their symptoms.","psychology"
"This meta-analytic review found that 51% of eating disorder prevention programs reduced eating disorder risk factors and 29% reduced current or future eating pathology. Larger effects occurred for programs that were selected (versus universal), interactive (versus didactic), multisession (versus single session), solely offered to females (versus both sexes), offered to participants over 15 years of age (versus younger ones), and delivered by professional interventionists (versus endogenous providers). Programs with body acceptance and dissonance-induction content and without psychoeducational content and programs evaluated in trials using validated measures and a shorter follow-up period also produced larger effects. Results identify promising programs and delineate sample, format, and design features associated with larger effects, which may inform the design of more effective prevention programs in the future.","psychology"
"For more than 30 years, the posttraumatic model (PTM) and the sociocognitive model (SCM) of dissociation have vied for attention and empirical support. We contend that neither perspective provides a satisfactory account and that dissociation and dissociative disorders (e.g., depersonalization/derealization disorder, dissociative identity disorder) can be understood as failures of normally adaptive systems and functions. We argue for a more encompassing transdiagnostic and transtheoretical perspective that considers potentially interactive variables including sleep disturbances; impaired self-regulation and inhibition of negative cognitions and affects; hyperassociation and set shifts; and deficits in reality testing, source attributions, and metacognition. We present an overview of the field of dissociation, delineate uncontested and converging claims across perspectives, summarize key multivariable studies in support of our framework, and identifyempirical pathways for future research to advance our understanding of dissociation, including studies of highly adverse events and dissociation.","psychology"
"Mental health researchers and clinicians have long sought answers to the question “What works for whom?” The goal of precision medicine is to provide evidence-based answers to this question. Treatment selection in depression aims to help each individual receive the treatment, among the available options, that is most likely to lead to a positive outcome for them. Although patient variables that are predictive of response to treatment have been identified, this knowledge has not yet translated into real-world treatment recommendations. The Personalized Advantage Index (PAI) and related approaches combine information obtained prior to the initiation of treatment into multivariable prediction models that can generate individualized predictions to help clinicians and patients select the right treatment. With increasing availability of advanced statistical modeling approaches, as well as novel predictive variables and big data, treatment selection models promise to contribute to improved outcomes in depression.","psychology"
"Methods for handling missing data in clinical psychology studies are reviewed. Missing data are defined, and a taxonomy of main approaches to analysis is presented, including complete-case and available-case analysis, weighting, maximum likelihood, Bayes, single and multiple imputation, and augmented inverse probability weighting. Missingness mechanisms, which play a key role in the performance of alternative methods, are defined. Approaches to robust inference, and to inference when the mechanism is potentially missing not at random, are discussed.","psychology"
"Contrary to clinical lore, a dependent personality style is associated with active as well as passive behavior and may be adaptive in certain contexts (e.g., in fostering compliance with medical and psychotherapeutic treatment regimens). The cognitive/interactionist model conceptualizes dependency-related responding in terms of four components: (a) motivational (a marked need for guidance, support, and approval from others); (b) cognitive (a perception of oneself as powerless and ineffectual); (c) affective (a tendency to become anxious when required to function autonomously); and (d) behavioral (use of diverse self-presentation strategies to strengthen ties to potential caregivers). Clinicians' understanding of the etiology and dynamics of dependency has improved substantially in recent years; current challenges include delineating useful subtypes of dependency, developing valid symptom criteria for Dependent Personality Disorder in DSM-5 and beyond, and working effectively with dependent patients in the age of managed care.","psychology"
"The use of repeated, momentary, real-world assessment methods known as the Experience Sampling Method and Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) has been broadly embraced over the last few decades. These methods have extended our assessment reach beyond lengthy retrospective self-reports as they can capture everyday experiences in their immediate context, including affect, behavior, symptoms, and cognitions. In this review we evaluate nine conceptual, methodological, and psychometric issues about EMA with the goal of stimulating conversation and guiding future research on these matters: the extent to which participants are actually reporting momentary experiences, respondents’ interpretation of momentary questions, the use of comparison standards in responding, efforts to increase the EMA reporting period beyond the moment to longer periods within a day, training of EMA study participants, concerns about selection bias of respondents, the impact of missing EMA assessments, the reliability of momentary data, and for which purposes EMA might be considered a gold standard for assessment. Resolution of these issues should have far-reaching implications for advancing the field.","psychology"
"Social Safety Theory hypothesizes that developing and maintaining friendly social bonds is a fundamental organizing principle of human behavior and that threats to social safety are a critical feature of psychological stressors that increase risk for disease. Central to this formulation is the fact that the human brain and immune system are principally designed to keep the body biologically safe, which they do by continually monitoring and responding to social, physical, and microbial threats in the environment. Because situations involving social conflict, isolation, devaluation, rejection, and exclusion historically increased risk for physical injury and infection, anticipatory neural–immune reactivity to social threat was likely highly conserved. This neurocognitive and immunologic ability for humans to symbolically represent and respond to potentially dangerous social situations is ultimately critical for survival. When sustained, however, this multilevel biological threat response can increase individuals’ risk for viral infections and several inflammation-related disease conditions that dominate present-day morbidity and mortality.","psychology"
"Interoception refers to the process by which the nervous system senses and integrates signals originating from within the body, providing a momentary mapping of the body's internal landscape and its relationship to the outside world. Active inference is based on the premise that afferent sensory input to the brain is constantly shaped and modified by prior expectations. In this review we propose that interoceptive psychopathology results from two primary interoceptive dysfunctions: First, individuals have abnormally strong expectations of the situations that elicit bodily change (i.e., hyperprecise priors), and second, they have great difficulty adjusting these expectations when the environment changes (i.e., context rigidity). Here we discuss how these dysfunctions potentially manifest in mental illness and how interventions aimed at altering interoceptive processing can help the brain create a more realistic model of its internal state.","psychology"
"In this review, we explore recent developments in the area of linear and nonlinear generalized mixed-effects regression models and various alternatives, including generalized estimating equations for analysis of longitudinal data. Methods are described for continuous and normally distributed as well as categorical (binary, ordinal, nominal) and count (Poisson) variables. Extensions of the model to three and four levels of clustering, multivariate outcomes, and incorporation of design weights are also described. Linear and nonlinear models are illustrated using an example involving a study of the relationship between mood and smoking.","psychology"
"The personalized approach to psychopathology conceptualizes mental disorder as a complex system of contextualized dynamic processes that is nontrivially specific to each individual, and it seeks to develop formal idiographic statistical models to represent these individual processes. Although the personalized approach draws on long-standing influences in clinical psychology, there has been an explosion of research in recent years following the development of intensive longitudinal data capture and statistical techniques that facilitate modeling of the dynamic processes of each individual's pathology. Advances are also making idiographic analyses scalable and generalizable. We review emerging research using the personalized approach in descriptive psychopathology, precision assessment, and treatment selection and tailoring, and we identify future challenges and areas in need of additional research. The personalized approach to psychopathology holds promise to resolve thorny diagnostic issues, generate novel insights, and improve the timing and efficacy of interventions.","psychology"
"This review highlights recent advances in research addressing intimate partner relationships and health. Consideration of the strong mutual influences that the members of a couple have on each other's mental and physical health trajectories provides a new way to view the health implications of couples’ convergence or interdependence; marital closeness can have a clear downside when one partner has mental or physical health problems. Couples’ interconnectedness can also be leveraged to promote better treatment outcomes. Major themes include the pivotal role of depression and the importance of gender differences in the pathways from the marital relationship to physiological functioning and health. The health risks and benefits of support are weighed. Additionally, two prominent emerging paths from marital distress to poor health are emphasized: sleep problems and metabolic alterations that promote obesity and its comorbidities.","psychology"
"Children of immigrants represent one in four children in the United States and will represent one in three children by 2050. Children of Asian and Latino immigrants together represent the majority of children of immigrants in the United States. Children of immigrants may be immigrants themselves, or they may have been born in the United States to foreign-born parents; their status may be legal or undocumented. We review transcultural and culture-specific factors that influence the various ways in which stressors are experienced; we also discuss the ways in which parental socialization and developmental processes function as risk factors or protective factors in their influence on the mental health of children of immigrants. Children of immigrants with elevated risk for mental health problems are more likely to be undocumented immigrants, refugees, or unaccompanied minors.

"In network approaches to psychopathology, disorders result from the causal interplay between symptoms (e.g., worry → insomnia → fatigue), possibly involving feedback loops (e.g., a person may engage in substance abuse to forget the problems that arose due to substance abuse). The present review examines methodologies suited to identify such symptom networks and discusses network analysis techniques that may be used to extract clinically and scientifically useful information from such networks (e.g., which symptom is most central in a person's network). The authors also show how network analysis techniques may be used to construct simulation models that mimic symptom dynamics. Network approaches naturally explain the limited success of traditional research strategies, which are typically based on the idea that symptoms are manifestations of some common underlying factor, while offering promising methodological alternatives. In addition, these techniques may offer possibilities to guide and evaluate therapeutic interventions.","psychology"
"The number of refugees and internally displaced people in 2022 is the largest since World War II, and meta-analyses demonstrate that these people experience elevated rates of mental health problems. This review focuses on the role of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in refugee mental health and includes current knowledge of the prevalence of PTSD, risk factors, and apparent differences that exist between PTSD in refugee populations and PTSD in other populations. An emerging literature on understanding mechanisms of PTSD encompasses neural, cognitive, and social processes, which indicate that these factors may not function exactly as they have functioned previously in other PTSD populations. This review recognizes the numerous debates in the literature on PTSD in refugees, including those on such issues as the conceptualization of mental health and the applicability of the PTSD diagnosis across cultures, as well as the challenge of treating PTSD in low- and middle-income countries that lack mental health resources to offer standard PTSD treatments.","psychology"
"In the second half of the twentieth century, twin and family studies established beyond a reasonable doubt that all forms of psychopathology are substantially heritable and highly polygenic. These conclusions were simultaneously an important theoretical advance and a difficult methodological obstacle, as it became clear that heritability is universal and undifferentiated across forms of psychopathology, and the radical polygenicity of genetic effects limits the biological insight provided by genetically informed studies at the phenotypic level. The paradigm-shifting revolution brought on by the Human Genome Project has recapitulated the great methodological promise and the profound theoretical difficulties of the twin study era. We review these issues using the rubric of genetic architecture, which we define as a search for specific genetic insight that adds to the general conclusion that psychopathology is heritable and polygenic. Although significant problems remain, we see many promising avenues for progress.","psychology"
"The relation between risk and outcome consists of myriad, complex, longitudinal processes. To study these relations requires research designs and statistical methods that are sensitive to the longitudinal structure of the risk, the outcome, and the risk-outcome relation. This review presents four longitudinal characteristics that can complicate psychopathology risk-outcome research. We represent each complication with an example data set. We demonstrate how conventional statistical approaches can yield highly misleading results. Finally, we review alternative statistical approaches that can handle these complications quite well.","psychology"
"Schools have long been the primary setting for children's mental health services but have neither the resources nor the expertise to manage these services independently. The critical importance of school success for children's adjustment provides a strong rationale for schooling as an essential component of children's mental health services. In this article, we review evidence for how schooling and mental health coalesce, suggesting an alignment of school and community mental health resources that prioritizes successful schooling as a key mental health outcome. We describe collaborative principles and ecological practices that advance a public health focus on children's mental health while also reducing the burden on schools to maintain mental health services. We close with a model of mental health services illustrating these principles and practices in high-poverty urban schools and propose future directions for research and practice to promote positive mental health for all children and youth.","psychology"
"This article reviews evidence that trait impulsivity—expressed early in life as the hyperactive–impulsive and combined presentations of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)—is a bottom-up, subcortically mediated vulnerability to all externalizing disorders. This vulnerability arises from deficient mesolimbic dopamine responding, which imbues psychological states (irritability, discontentment) that motivate excessive approach behavior (hyperactivity, impulsivity). Through complex interactions with (a) aversive motivational states that arise from largely independent subcortical systems, (b) emotion regulatory mechanisms that arise from top-down, cortical modulation of subcortical neural function, and (c) environmental risk factors that shape and maintain emotion dysregulation, trait impulsivity confers vulnerability to increasingly severe externalizing behaviors across development. This perspective highlights the importance of identifying transdiagnostic neural vulnerabilities to psychopathology; dovetails with the hierarchical, latent structure of psychopathology; and suggests that progression along the externalizing spectrum is an ontogenic process whereby a common, multifactorially inherited trait interacts with endogenous and exogenous influences to yield increasingly intractable externalizing behaviors across development.","psychology"
"This article reviews the current state of knowledge and promising new directions concerning the psychology of pandemics. Pandemics are disease outbreaks that spread globally. Historically, psychological factors have been neglected by researchers and health authorities despite evidence that pandemics are, to a large extent, psychological phenomena whereby beliefs and behaviors influence the spreading versus containment of infection. Psychological factors are important in determining ( a) adherence to pandemic mitigation methods (e.g., adherence to social distancing), ( b) pandemic-related social disruption (e.g., panic buying, racism, antilockdown protests), and ( c) pandemic-related distress and related problems (e.g., anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, prolonged grief disorder). The psychology of pandemics has emerged as an important field of research and practice during the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. As a scholarly discipline, the psychology of pandemics is fragmented and diverse, encompassing various psychological subspecialties and allied disciplines, but is vital for shaping clinical practice and public health guidelines for COVID-19 and future pandemics.","psychology"
"Mobilizing lay health workers (LHWs) to deliver evidence-based treatments (EBTs) is a workforce strategy to address mental health disparities in underserved communities. LHWs can be leveraged to support access to EBTs in a variety of ways, from conducting outreach for EBTs delivered by professional providers to serving as the primary treatment providers. This critical review provides an overview of how LHW-supported or -delivered EBTs have been leveraged in low-, middle-, and high-income countries (HICs). We propose a conceptual model for LHWs to address drivers of service disparities, which relate to the overall supply of the EBTs provided and the demand for these treatments. The review provides illustrative case examples that demonstrate how LHWs have been leveraged globally and domestically to increase access to mental health services. It also discusses challenges and recommendations regarding implementing LHW-supported or -delivered EBTs.","psychology"
"The Social Security Administration (SSA) oversees two disability programs, Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI). Adults with mental impairments represent a very large component of the programs. Policy makers and SSA are concerned about the accuracy of disability determination and also about low levels of labor force participation among individuals with disabilities. Adults with mental impairments are challenging to assess for work-related functional limitations. They are also a challenge to return to labor force participation. SSA has sponsored several demonstration research programs focusing on improving the accuracy of disability determination and on interventions in supported employment to return individuals with mental impairments to competitive employment. This article reviews the demonstration research focused on both entry into the disability system (at the “front door”) and potential exit from it (through the “back door”). All of the research holds promise to “right-size” the SSA disability program.","psychology"
"There are two divergent viewpoints on the phenomenology and outcome of bipolar I (BP I) disorder in youth. Disparities evolved as unintended consequences from investigators' inconsistencies both in translating the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)-III, DSM-III-R, and DSM-IV criteria and in operationalizing them differently in their standardized assessments. Rates of conservatively diagnosed BP I are lower both in community studies of youths than in adults and from liberally defined BP I in youths. Rates of co-occurring attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are lower in conservatively than liberally defined children and adolescents with BP I. Rates of both BP I and of ADHD are lower in offspring of BP I probands, and outcome more closely approximates that of adults with BP I in conservatively versus liberally defined children and teens with BP I. Both perspectives can claim evidence for reliability and validity that support their positions. However, the samples are so different that it is difficult to compare studies conducted from these different perspectives.","psychology"
"The proposal that psychologists should pursue prescriptive authority was first put forth 25 years ago, and it has been an official goal of the American Psychological Association for 15 years. Since then some form of prescriptive authority has been approved by three states, the Territory of Guam, and three branches of the military. Psychologists are also eligible to prescribe in the Public Health Service and the Indian Health Service. The movement has generated strong opinions both in favor and in opposition. Supporters focus particularly on increasing access to appropriate care and changing the role of psychologists within the healthcare system, while opponents raise concerns about how prescriptive authority will change professional psychology and whether psychologists will prescribe safely. This review provides a summary of milestones in the movement to date, as well as the arguments that have been raised for and against prescriptive authority.","psychology"
"Treatment and prevention efforts guided by psychological theory, research, and practice can have outcomes of greater value than the resources consumed by those efforts—and outcomes superior to those attainable by other means, often at lower costs. How can we make this hope true more often, for more of the clients who need our services, despite severe resource constraints? Routinely reporting the costs, effectiveness, and benefits of psychological interventions from client, practitioner, and societal perspectives is only a beginning. We also need to use descriptive and inferential statistics to measure, report, and analyze the cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit of our interventions to discover the strongest determinants of intervention costs and outcomes. The emerging literature on cost-inclusive research in psychology suggests that delivery systems are one primary determinant of costs and outcomes of most interventions, as are the psychological techniques applied.","psychology"
"Although the fear response is an adaptive response to threatening situations, a number of psychiatric disorders feature prominent fear-related symptoms caused, in part, by failures of extinction and inhibitory learning. The translational nature of fear conditioning paradigms has enabled us to develop a nuanced understanding of extinction and inhibitory learning based on the molecular substrates to systems neural circuitry and psychological mechanisms. This knowledge has facilitated the development of novel interventions that may augment extinction and inhibitory learning. These interventions include nonpharmacological techniques, such as behavioral methods to implement during psychotherapy, as well as device-based stimulation techniques that enhance or reduce activity in different regions of the brain. There is also emerging support for a number of psychopharmacological interventions that may augment extinction and inhibitory learning specifically if administered in conjunction with exposure-based psychotherapy. This growing body of research may offer promising novel techniques to address debilitating transdiagnostic fear-related symptoms.","psychology"
"Individuals with schizophrenia experience a range of cognitive deficits and associated dysfunctions in the neural systems that support cognitive processes. This chapter reviews the literature on disturbances in working memory, executive control, and episodic memory in schizophrenia. Advances in basic cognitive neuroscience are described to help explain the cognitive neuroscience of schizophrenia. For working memory in schizophrenia, evidence is reviewed regarding deficits in the verbal (phonological loop) and nonverbal (visual-spatial scratch pad) buffer systems as well as in the central executive function. In the domain of episodic memory, evidence is reviewed for deficits in recollection versus familiarity processes in episodic memory. Also discussed are conceptual issues and potential confounds relevant to understanding the cognitive neuroscience of schizophrenia, including the role that cognitive deficits play in the developmental course of schizophrenia, relationships to specific symptom domains, behavioral performance confounds, and medication influences on behavioral performance and brain function.","psychology"
"Aging has effects on many features of normal functioning, particularly in the domains of cognition and adaptive life skills. Several psychiatric conditions also affect cognition and adaptive functioning; most of the research on these topics has been performed on patients early in their lives. The amount of research on older patients is smaller than in younger patients, but there is a developing research literature in several aspects of aging and psychopathology. This chapter reviews aging effects on two major psychiatric conditions: schizophrenia and depression. We examine changes in symptoms and cognitive functioning with aging and the functional implications of the development or worsening of cognitive performance. We also identify risk factors for cognitive changes within each condition and examine the implication of early- versus late-life onset. We believe that cognitive changes with aging are potentially predictable, possibly sharing a mechanism with normal aging-related changes and certainly laden with prognostic implications. We see cognitive changes as a possible commonality across persistent psychiatric disorders as well as healthy aging in late life.","psychology"
"For over two decades, theorists have suggested that mania relates to heightened sensitivity of the behavioral activation system (BAS). In this article, we review a burgeoning empirical literature on this model, drawing on both cross-sectional and prospective studies. As evidence has emerged for this model, we argue that it is time to consider more specific aspects of BAS sensitivity in this disorder. We review evidence that bipolar disorder relates to an increased willingness to expend effort toward reward and to increases in energy and goal pursuit after an initial reward. We conclude by considering the strengths and weaknesses of this literature, with an eye toward future directions and implications for treatment.","psychology"
"This review examines neuroimaging and neurocognitive findings on alcohol-related toxicity in adolescents. Teens who meet criteria for alcohol use disorders, as well as those who engage in subdiagnostic binge drinking behaviors, often show poorer neurocognitive performance, alterations in gray and white matter brain structure, and discrepant functional brain activation patterns when compared to nonusing and demographically matched controls. Abnormalities are also observed in teens with a family history of alcoholism, and such differences in neuromaturation may leave youths at increased risk for the development of an alcohol use disorder or increased substance use severity. More prospective investigations are needed, and future work should focus on disentangling preexisting differences from dose-dependent effects of alcohol on neurodevelopment. Intervention strategies that utilize neuroimaging findings (e.g., identified weaknesses in particular neural substrates and behavioral correlates) may be helpful in both prevention and intervention campaigns for teens both pre- and postinitiation of alcohol use.","psychology"
"Effective tobacco policies are important for reducing the harm of tobacco use and can have a broad impact at the population level. This review provides an overview of how clinical science can inform tobacco policies with a focus on policies related to flavored tobacco products, using menthol cigarettes as an illustrative example. Specifically, this review summarizes the role of flavors in tobacco use and the history of regulation of flavored tobacco products by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), provides an overview of clinical research methods used to contribute to the scientific evidence to inform FDA tobacco policies, discusses key findings related to menthol tobacco products using these methods, and proposes future directions for clinical research. As the tobacco marketplace continues to evolve with new products and flavor chemicals, ongoing clinical science will be essential for establishing evidence-based policies to protect public health and reduce tobacco-related health disparities.","psychology"
"The Alternative Model of Personality Disorders (AMPD) is a dimensional, empirically based diagnostic system developed to overcome the serious limitations of traditional categories. We review the mounting evidence on its convergent and discriminant validity, with an incursion into the less-studied ICD-11 system. In the literature, the AMPD's Pathological Trait Model (Criterion B) shows excellent convergence with normal personality traits, and it could be useful as an organizing framework for mental disorders. In contrast, Personality Functioning (Criterion A) cannot be distinguished from personality traits, lacks both discriminant and incremental validity, and has a shaky theoretical background. We offer some suggestions with a view to the future. These include removing Criterion A, using the real-life consequences of traits as indicators of severity, delving into the dynamic mechanisms underlying traits, and furthering the integration of currently disengaged psychological paradigms that can shape a sounder clinical science.","psychology"
"In the United States, an estimated 4.2 million young people experience homelessness during critical stages in their development—adolescence and emerging adulthood. While research on youth homelessness often emphasizes risk and vulnerability, the field must situate these issues within the developmental trajectories of adolescence and emerging adulthood to effectively prevent and end youth homelessness. This review uses the Risk Amplification and Abatement Model (RAAM) as a conceptual framework for contextualizing the landscape of youth homelessness research in the United States since 2010. An extension of ecological models of risk-taking, RAAM emphasizes both risk and resilience, positing that negative as well as positive socialization processes across interactions with family, peers, social services, and formal institutions affect key housing, health, and behavioral outcomes for youth experiencing homelessness. This review applies RAAM to our understanding of the causes and consequences of youth homelessness, recent interventions, and recommendations for future directions.","psychology"
"In recent years there has been a surge of research conducted on the impostor phenomenon, with approximately half of all impostor phenomenon articles being published between 2020 and 2022 and growing interest in understanding how the impostor phenomenon affects racially and ethnically minoritized individuals. Questions around intersectionality remain about how to apply the impostor phenomenon to the experiences of minoritized individuals. In this review, we revisit the historical context of the impostor phenomenon. We address issues of nomenclature and current controversies regarding whether the impostor phenomenon (a) blames the victim, (b) should be included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), and (c) is beneficial for individuals. In addition, we address the limitations of current research on racially and ethnically minoritized individuals, especially women of color. Finally, we conclude by discussing the need for a reconceptualized racialized impostor phenomenon as well as the need to establish new impostor phenomenon measures, conduct more quantitative research with diverse samples, and create culturally tailored interventions.","psychology"
"It is vital to elucidate how risk factors work together to predict eating disorder onset because it should improve the yield of prevention efforts. Risk factors that have predicted eating disorder onset in multiple studies include low body mass index (BMI) for anorexia nervosa; thin-ideal internalization, perceived pressure to be thin, body dissatisfaction, dieting, and negative affect for bulimia nervosa; and body dissatisfaction and dieting for purging disorder. No such risk factors have been identified for binge eating disorder. Classification tree analyses have identified several amplifying interactions, mitigating interactions, and alternative pathway interactions between risk factors, such as evidence that elevated BMI amplifies the risk between appearance overvaluation and the future onset of recurrent binge eating. However, there have been no tests of mediational risk factor models in the prediction of eating disorder onset. Gaps in the literature are identified and procedures for providing rigorous tests of interactive and mediational etiologic models are outlined.","psychology"
"The mood disorders—primarily major depressive disorder and bipolar affective disorder—constitute one of the world's greatest public health problems and are associated with significant reductions in productivity, health, and longevity. In addition, people who suffer from these common illnesses, along with their families and loved ones, experience an incalculable toll on quality of life. Dating to the introduction of the first effective therapies for mood disorders in the late 1950s and 1960s, various types of pharmacotherapy have become a mainstay for the management of mood disorders, particularly more severe, chronic, and recurrent forms of depression and most forms of bipolar disorder. This review examines recent developments in the pharmacotherapy of both forms of mood disorder, comparing the newer antidepressants such as the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors with their predecessors (the monoamine oxidase inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants) and likewise comparing the older standard for management of bipolar disorder, lithium, with newer classes of medications, such as a selected group of anticonvulsants and the atypical antipsychotics. Although these newer classes of medications have generally improved upon the earlier treatments in terms of better tolerability and safety, there are no universally effective pharmacologic treatments for mood disorders, and careful medical management of these medications is still warranted.","psychology"
"The exponential rise in the number of functional brain connectivity studies, particularly those examining intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC) at rest, and the promises of this work for unraveling the ontogeny of functional neural systems motivate this review. Shortly before this explosion in functional connectivity research, developmental neuroscientists had proposed theories based on neural systems models to explain behavioral changes, particularly in adolescence. The current review presents recent advances in imaging in brain connectivity research, which provides a unique tool for the study of neural systems. Understanding the potential of neuroimaging for refining neurodevelopmental models of brain function requires a description of various functional connectivity approaches. In this review, we describe task-based and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) analytic strategies, but we focus on iFC findings from resting-state data to describe general developmental trajectories of brain network organization. Finally, we use the example of drug addiction to frame a discussion of psychopathology that emerges in adolescence.","psychology"
"Irritability is a common and impairing clinical presentation in children and adolescents. Despite its significant public health impact, irritability remains an elusive construct. Chronic and severe irritability is the primary symptom of the new DSM-5 diagnosis, disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD). However, empirical and clinical approaches to irritability are in their relative infancy, and questions regarding the validity of the DMDD diagnosis have been raised. Moreover, irritability is a trait distributed continuously in youth, thereby fitting within the National Institute of Mental Health Research Domain Criteria initiative. Thus, there are opportunities for scientific review and integration. Accordingly, the goals of this review include (a) clarifying the definitions of irritability, incorporating clinical and translational animal work; (b) reviewing the historical context surrounding the study of irritability; (c) reviewing the prevalence, clinical correlates, and longitudinal course of irritability; (d) presenting behavioral and neurobiological findings associated with irritability; and (e) exploring treatment options and proposing future directions for research.","psychology"
"Whether one takes a biological, psychological, or psychosocial perspective, depression in mothers raises concerns about risks for the development of psychopathology in the children. This review addresses the complexity of that risk and the essential role of development in a model that explains processes of transmission. This article addresses the following aims: (a) to provide convincing evidence that depression in mothers is an important topic for clinical psychologists; (b) to summarize current theoretical models of mechanisms of risk for the development of psychopathology in children of depressed mothers and the status of empirical support for those models; (c) to examine the theoretical bases and current status of evidence for moderators of this risk; (d) to argue for the advantages to be gained from a developmental psychopathology perspective on this topic; and (e) to point to future directions for theory, research, and practice.","psychology"
"Pedophilia is defined as a sexual interest in prepubescent children. It is empirically linked with sexual offending against children: Child pornography offenders and sex offenders with child victims are more likely to be pedophiles based on self-report or objective measures of sexual interests. At the same time, some pedophiles have not had any known sexual contact with children, and perhaps half of sex offenders against children would not meet diagnostic criteria for pedophilia. Pedophilia can be diagnosed using a variety of methods and is an important factor to consider in the assessment of sex offenders because pedophilic offenders are more likely to sexually reoffend and require different interventions. There is no evidence to suggest that pedophilia can be changed. Instead, interventions are designed to increase voluntary control over sexual arousal, reduce sex drive, or teach self-management skills to individuals who are motivated to avoid acting upon their sexual interests.","psychology"
"There has been an explosion of interest in studying gene-environment interactions (GxE) as they relate to the development of psychopathology. In this article, I review different methodologies to study gene-environment interaction, providing an overview of methods from animal and human studies and illustrations of gene-environment interactions detected using these various methodologies. Gene-environment interaction studies that examine genetic influences as modeled latently (e.g., from family, twin, and adoption studies) are covered, as well as studies of measured genotypes. Importantly, the explosion of interest in gene-environment interactions has raised a number of challenges, including difficulties with differentiating various types of interactions, power, and the scaling of environmental measures, which have profound implications for detecting gene-environment interactions. Taking research on gene-environment interactions to the next level will necessitate close collaborations between psychologists and geneticists so that each field can take advantage of the knowledge base of the other.","psychology"
"The past several years have seen a surge of interest in using risk assessment in criminal sentencing, both to reduce recidivism by incapacitating or treating high-risk offenders and to reduce prison populations by diverting low-risk offenders from prison. We begin by sketching jurisprudential theories of sentencing, distinguishing those that rely on risk assessment from those that preclude it. We then characterize and illustrate the varying roles that risk assessment may play in the sentencing process. We clarify questions regarding the various meanings of “risk” in sentencing and the appropriate time to assess the risk of convicted offenders. We conclude by addressing four principal problems confronting risk assessment in sentencing: conflating risk and blame, barring individual inferences based on group data, failing adequately to distinguish risk assessment from risk reduction, and ignoring whether, and if so, how, the use of risk assessment in sentencing affects racial and economic disparities in imprisonment.","psychology"
"The current article reviews extant literature on the intersection between poverty and the development of conduct problems (CP) in early childhood. Associations between exposure to poverty and disruptive behavior are reviewed through the framework of models emphasizing how the stressors associated with poverty indirectly influence child CP by compromising parent psychological resources, investments in children's welfare, and/or caregiving quality. We expand on the best-studied model, the family stress model, by emphasizing the mediating contribution of parent psychological resources on children's risk for early CP, in addition to the mediating effects of parenting. Specifically, we focus on the contribution of maternal depression, in terms of both compromising parenting quality and exposing children to higher levels of stressful events and contexts. Implications of the adapted family stress model are then discussed in terms of its implications for the prevention and treatment of young children's emerging CP.","psychology"
"We survey the utility of animal models of mental illness, based on the identification of possible neurocognitive or neurobehavioral endophenotypes. Three broad clusters of neuropsychiatric disorder are discussed: (a) impulsive-compulsive syndromes, comprising drug addiction, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, gambling, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and compulsive eating; (b) disorders at the cognitive-emotional interface, comprising anxiety, depression, and schizophrenia; and (c) disorders purely of cognition, which contribute to the third cluster, cognitive disorders. The emphasis is thus on modeling symptoms rather than disorders per se. We also distinguish between two main aspects of any validated model: the precise neurobehavioral or neurocognitive processes implicated from detailed study of the clinical phenotype, and the perturbations, whether typically genetic, environmental, pharmacological, or neurodevelopmental, that are designed to simulate relevant neural, neurochemical, or molecular aspects of particular neuropsychiatric disorders.","psychology"
"Evidence is growing that several computer-aided psychotherapy (CP) systems can effectively improve a range of common mental health problems. Most clients find CP acceptable because of its convenience, confidentiality, and reduction of stigma. CP can be accessed in a clinic, but recently clients have used CP especially on the Internet at home, with brief support on a telephone helpline and/or by email. Brief and efficient screening and support greatly reduce attrition. CP's efficacy, and encouragement of its dissemination and implementation by some national funding bodies and governmental agencies, has led to its spread as a regular care option and is increasing access to psychological therapies in some countries. Transfer of this new approach from use in tight research studies to use as an integrated part of everyday care under widely varying conditions generates teething problems that are being managed in diverse ways across different centers. Anonymized Internet audit of CP outcomes facilitates effective care and clinical governance. This review examines the current state of the art as well as the science and broad applications of CP.","psychology"
"Early-onset disorders (e.g., conduct problems, autism) show a marked male preponderance, whereas adolescent-onset disorders (e.g., depression, anxiety) show a marked female preponderance. A developmental psychopathology framework provides a means to investigate complex gender-related etiologies of these different disorders. This review focuses on biological and environmental factors implicated in the development of conduct problems and depression in boys and girls. Boys and girls showed certain differences in types, rates, comorbidities, antecedents, correlates, and trajectories of these problems. Origins of male and female preponderant problems are likely to be rooted, in part, in biological, physical, cognitive, and social-emotional differences in boys and girls that can precede the expression of clinical problems. These male-like and female-like characteristics are considered regarding conduct problems and depression to explore how they inform biological and environmental theories about gender and psychopathology. At the same time, because boys and girls also show many similarities, it is important to avoid sex-stereotyping mental health problems.","psychology"
"Bipolar disorder is a lifelong mood disorder characterized by extreme mood swings between mania and depression. Despite fitness costs associated with increased mortality and significant impairment, bipolar disorder has persisted in the population with a high heritability and a stable prevalence. Creativity and other positive traits have repeatedly been associated with the bipolar spectrum, particularly among unaffected first-degree relatives and those with milder expressions of bipolar traits. This suggests a model in which large doses of risk variants cause illness, but mild to moderate doses confer advantages, which serve to maintain bipolar disorder in the population. Bipolar disorder may thus be better conceptualized as a dimensional trait existing at the extreme of normal population variation in positive temperament, personality, and cognitive traits, aspects of which may reflect a shared vulnerability with creativity. Investigations of this shared vulnerability may provide insight into the genetic mechanisms underlying illness and suggest novel treatments.","psychology"
"Stability is thought to be one of the major distinguishing features between personality disorders (PDs) and other forms of psychopathology. The development of more reliable PD assessments and the implementation of four major longitudinal studies on PD stability have provided critical data with which to evaluate the stability of PD features. Results from these and other studies reveal significant complexity in the interpretation of PD stability because of several issues that can impact stability estimates. Such estimates will vary as a function of the type of constructs being assessed, the type of stability being considered, the modality and reliability of the assessments being used, and the impacts of sampling. In this article, longitudinal research on PD stability is reviewed in the context of these issues. It is concluded that no single answer can be given to the question, “How stable are PDs?” and that future research and classification need to consider carefully and account for the complexity of this question.","psychology"
"Behavioral genetics research has opened a new window on understanding personality disorder. The earliest studies were focused on establishing the relative contributions of genes and the environment in these disorders. Although these studies provided solid evidence of the importance of genetic and environmental influences on personality disorder and showed that all aspects of personality disorder are subject to genetic influence, heritability studies are limited because they are not helpful in explicating causal mechanisms. More recent research has focused on the relative contributions of the covariation of personality disorder diagnoses and traits, which allows one to examine etiological relationships. These developments are leading to major changes in ideas about what constitutes the environment and nature of the interplay between genes and environment. The present review examines major themes in this growing body of research in the context of current issues in the personality disorders.","psychology"
"The predominant dimensional model of general personality structure within psychology is the five-factor model (FFM). Research indicates that the personality disorders of the American Psychiatric Association's diagnostic manual can be understood as maladaptive variants of the domains and facets of the FFM. The current review provides a proposal for the classification of personality disorder from the perspective of the FFM. Discussed as well are implications and issues associated with an FFM of personality disorder, including the integration of a psychiatric nomenclature with general personality structure, the inclusion of a domain of openness to experience, the identification of problems in living associated with maladaptive personality traits, the setting of a diagnostic threshold, prototypal matching, feasibility, and clinical utility.","psychology"
"There is little doubt that nicotine addiction sustains tobacco use in most people and that individual variation in response to tobacco has a strong biological basis. However, the great diversity in tobacco use behaviors observed between countries and within countries over time suggests that biology alone cannot fully explain these variations. This review examines the role of the social environment in understanding tobacco use behaviors and efforts to curb tobacco use at the population level. We conclude that the social environment plays a critical role in determining how innate biological factors involved in nicotine dependency actually get expressed at the population level. Tobacco use as reflected in population trends is seen as the product of the interaction of agent, host, and environmental factors. Government policies are seen as an important modifiable environmental influence that can alter how tobacco products are designed and marketed (agent factors) and how consumers perceive the risks and benefits of smoking (host factors). Evidence suggests that synergy is gained when tobacco control interventions directed at agent, host, and environmental factors are implemented together.","psychology"
"The nomenclature of personality disorders in the 11th revision of the International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems represents the most radical change in the classification history of personality disorders. A dimensional structure now replaces categorical description. It was argued by the Working Group that only a dimensional system was consistent with the empirical evidence and, in the spirit of clinical utility, the new system is based on two steps. The first step is to assign one of five levels of severity, and the second step is to assign up to five prominent domain traits. There was resistance to this structure from those who feel that categorical diagnosis, particularly of borderline personality disorder, should be retained. After lengthy discussion, described in detail here, there is now an option for a borderline pattern descriptor to be selected as a diagnostic option after severity has been determined.","psychology"
"The treatment of patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD) is challenging. Making a diagnosis is necessary to plan therapy. But since we do not know the etiology of BPD, treatment cannot be based on a well-established theory. Outcome research shows that most patients recover with time. A series of clinical trials show that a variety of psychotherapies are effective in BPD and that the effects of medication are unimpressive.","psychology"
"Numerous studies associate childhood exposure to intimate partner violence (IPV) with adverse adjustment in the domains of mental health, social, and academic functioning. This review synthesizes this literature and highlights the critical role of child self-regulation in mediating children's adjustment outcomes. We discuss major methodological problems of the field, including failure to consider the effects of prenatal IPV exposure and the limitations of variable-oriented and cross-sectional approaches. Finally, we present a comprehensive theoretical model of the effects of IPV on children's development. This model includes three mechanistic pathways—one that is unique to IPV (maternal representations) and two that are consistent with the effects of other stressors (maternal mental health and physiological functioning). In our model, the effects of these three pathways on child adjustment outcomes are mediated through parenting and child self-regulation. Future research directions and clinical implications are discussed in the context of the model.","psychology"
"A comprehensive understanding of psychosis requires models that link multiple levels of explanation: the neurobiological, the cognitive, the subjective, and the social. Until we can bridge several explanatory gaps, it is difficult to explain how neurobiological perturbations can manifest in bizarre beliefs or hallucinations, or how trauma or social adversity can perturb lower-level brain processes. We propose that the predictive processing framework has much to offer in this respect. We show how this framework may underpin and complement source monitoring theories of delusions and hallucinations and how, when considered in terms of a dynamic and hierarchical system, it may provide a compelling model of several key clinical features of psychosis. We see little conflict between source monitoring theories and predictive coding. The former act as a higher-level description of a set of capacities, and the latter aims to provide a deeper account of how these and other capacities may emerge.","psychology"
"Telomeres play an important part in aging and show relationships to lifetime adversity, particularly childhood adversity. Meta-analyses demonstrate reliable associations between psychopathology (primarily depression) and shorter telomere length, but the nature of this relationship has not been fully understood. Here, we review and evaluate the evidence for impaired telomere biology as a consequence of psychopathology or as a contributing factor, and the important mediating roles of chronic psychological stress and impaired allostasis. There is evidence for a triadic relationship among stress, telomere shortening, and psychiatric disorders that is positively reinforcing and unfolds across the life course and, possibly, across generations. We review the role of genetics and biobehavioral responses that may contribute to shorter telomere length, as well as the neurobiological impact of impaired levels of telomerase. These complex interrelationships are important to elucidate because they have implications for mental and physical comorbidity and, potentially, for the prevention and treatment of depression.","psychology"
"Diagnostic systems, phenotype models, and theories of etiology incorporate propositions on the underlying nature of psychosis and schizophrenia phenotypes. These propositions, whether implicit or explicit, are that the distributions of the phenotypes, or the phenotype experiences themselves, are dimensional or categorical. On one hand, evidence on the epidemiology of schizophrenia phenotypes suggests symptom phenotypes may not be bound by conventional diagnostic thresholds but instead may blend imperceptibly with subclinical, statistically frequent experience, supporting continuum viewpoints. On the other hand, evidence on the population structure suggests a latent categorical structure; the population may be composed of two types of people. However, both sets of evidence are beset by methodological limitations that point unequivocally to the need to move beyond current diagnostic conceptualizations, observation, and anamnesis of psychosis, and toward responsive and scientifically refutable formulations of schizophrenia.","psychology"
"The reach of violence against women (VAW) has been profoundly felt by women across the United States and around the globe. VAW has been documented for decades as a legal and social justice problem, but as illuminated in this review, it is also a substantial mental health concern. A full understanding of the phenomenon must include discussion of how often it occurs, in what forms, and to whom. This review defines violence against women in its variant forms and examines the literature on the mental health effects associated with these abuse experiences. The effectiveness of the mental health system's response to the complex needs of women suffering battering, rape, stalking, and psychological aggression is also examined. The future of research and the important role of the discipline of psychology in the future of this field of study are discussed.","psychology"
"Depression is a common and debilitating condition that adversely affects functioning and the capacity to work and establish economic stability. Women are disproportionately burdened by depression, and low-income pregnant and parenting women have particularly high rates of depression and often lack access to treatment. As depression can be treated, it is a modifiable risk factor for poor economic outcomes for women, and thus for children and families. Recent national and state health care policy changes offer the opportunity for community-based psychological and economic interventions that can reduce the number of pregnant and parenting women with clinically significant depressive symptoms. Moreover, there is strong evidence that in addition to benefiting women's well-being, such reforms bolster children's emotional and social development and learning and help families rise out of poverty. This review summarizes the mental health and economic literature regarding how maternal depression perpetuates intergenerational poverty and discusses recommendations regarding policies to treat maternal depression in large-scale social services systems.","psychology"
"This review considers two themes. The first section describes the influence of two temperamental biases detectable in infants that render children vulnerable to maladaptive behavior if the rearing environment invites such responses. Infants who display high levels of limb activity and crying in response to unexpected events are likely to be shy and fearful as children and are at risk for an anxiety disorder. Infants who display little limb movement and crying are susceptible to assuming risks and vulnerable to asocial behavior if the rearing environment invites these actions. The second section criticizes three common research practices: failure to examine patterns of measures for predictors and outcomes, an indifference to the power of the setting on the evidence recorded, and the distortions that semantic terms in questionnaires impose on replies.","psychology"
"This review presents findings from an overview of meta-analyses of the effects of prevention and promotion programs to prevent mental health, substance use, and conduct problems. The review of 48 meta-analyses found small but significant changes that reduce depression, anxiety, antisocial behavior, and substance use. Furthermore, the results were sustained over time. Meta-analyses often found that the effects were heterogeneous. A conceptual model is proposed to guide the study of moderators of program effects in future meta-analyses, and methodological issues in synthesizing findings across preventive interventions are discussed.","psychology"
"We live in an age of psychopharmacology. One in six persons currently takes a psychotropic drug. These drugs have profoundly shaped our scientific and cultural understanding of psychiatric disease. By way of a historical review, we try to make sense of psychiatry's dependency on psychiatric drugs in the care of patients. Modern psychopharmacology began in 1950 with the synthesis of chlorpromazine. Over the course of the next 50 years, the psychiatric understanding and treatment of mental illness radically changed. Psychotropic drugs played a major part in these changes as state hospitals closed and psychotherapy gave way to drug prescriptions. Our review suggests that the success of psychopharmacology was not the consequence of increasingly more effective drugs for discrete psychiatric diseases. Instead, a complex mix of political economic realities, pharmaceutical marketing, basic science advances, and changes in the mental health-care system have led to our current infatuation with psychopharmacology.","psychology"
"Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), path analysis, and structural equation modeling (SEM) have long histories in clinical research. Although CFA has largely superseded EFA, CFAs of multidimensional constructs typically fail to meet standards of good measurement: goodness of fit, measurement invariance, lack of differential item functioning, and well-differentiated factors in support of discriminant validity. Part of the problem is undue reliance on overly restrictive CFAs in which each item loads on only one factor. Exploratory SEM (ESEM), an overarching integration of the best aspects of CFA/SEM and traditional EFA, provides confirmatory tests of a priori factor structures, relations between latent factors and multigroup/multioccasion tests of full (mean structure) measurement invariance. It incorporates all combinations of CFA factors, ESEM factors, covariates, grouping/multiple-indicator multiple-cause (MIMIC) variables, latent growth, and complex structures that typically have required CFA/SEM. ESEM has broad applicability to clinical studies that are not appropriately addressed either by traditional EFA or CFA/SEM.","psychology"
"The study of depression in mothers in relation to transmission of risk for the development of psychopathology in their children relies on solid foundations in the understanding of psychopathology, of development, and of developmental psychopathology per se. This article begins with a description of the scope of the problem, including a summary of knowledge of how mothers’ depression is associated with outcomes in children and of moderators of those associations. The sense of scope then informs a theoretical and empirical perspective on knowledge of mechanisms in those associations, with a focus on what has been learned in the past 20 years. Throughout the article, and in conclusions at the end, are suggestions for next steps in research and practice.","psychology"
"The present review summarizes our current knowledge of the development and management of anxiety in children and adolescents. Consideration is given to limitations of this knowledge and directions for future research. The review begins with coverage of the development and demographic correlates of anxiety in young people and then moves to systematic discussion of some of the key etiological factors, including genetics, temperament, parenting, and individual experiences. The second part of the review describes current treatment strategies and efficacy as well as factors thought to influence treatment outcome, including treatment features, child factors, and parent factors. The review concludes with brief coverage of some more recent developments in treatment including alternative models of delivery and prevention strategies.","psychology"
"Functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a noninvasive, highly repeatable, and increasingly available method to study disordered brain activity among patients with psychological or neurological disorders. In this chapter the biophysical principles underlying functional MRI are presented, and methodological limitations of the method are discussed. Artifacts related to the biophysical basis of the functional MRI signal or associated with image acquisition methods are presented, as are artifacts related to baseline effects—especially those associated with medication, caffeine, and nicotine use. The difficulties associated with the comparison of groups of subjects differing in performance receive special attention. The limitations of cognitive subtraction designs for functional MRI are also discussed. Functional MRI studies of schizophrenia patients are used to illustrate these points.","psychology"
"Research on psychopathy has progressed considerably in recent years against the backdrop of important advances in the broader field of clinical psychological science. My major aim in this review is to encourage integration of investigative work on dispositional, biobehavioral, and developmental aspects of psychopathy with counterpart work on general psychopathology. Using the triarchic model of psychopathy as a frame of reference, I offer perspective on long-standing debates pertaining to the conceptualization and assessment of psychopathy, discuss how dispositional facets of psychopathy relate to subdimensions of internalizing and externalizing psychopathology, and summarize findings from contemporary biobehavioral and developmental research on psychopathy. I conclude by describing a systematic strategy for coordinating biobehavioral-developmental research on psychopathy that can enable it to be informed by, and help inform, ongoing research on mental health problems more broadly.","psychology"
"Enormous progress in the field of clinical science has been made over the past 50 years, with advances in our understanding of psychopathology and more sophisticated research methodology leading to the development of more efficacious psychological treatments for a variety of behavioral disorders. Despite these advances, the public health impact of well-established psychological treatments is less than it should be. After an overview of the current status of the field, we identify barriers that must be overcome to maximize the public health impact and propose that to breach these barriers we must (a) augment the efficacy of treatments, (b) broaden the impact of treatments across diagnoses to include temperamental variables, (c) attend more closely to mechanisms of action of treatments, and (d) learn the best methods for disseminating and implementing psychological interventions. We conclude by proposing new directions in both research and clinical practice to accomplish these goals.","psychology"
"Clinical psychology emerged as a profession in the United States in the 1890s with studies conducted by psychologists with patients in the mental asylums of that time, and with the founding of Witmer's psychological clinic, where he treated children with learning and behavioral problems. This chapter traces the history of clinical psychology as a profession, from the focus on assessment at the turn of the twentieth century to the provision of psychotherapy that would come to dominate the field after World War II. It concludes with a discussion of some of the contemporary concerns in the profession and how those might impact the future practice of clinical psychologists.","psychology"
"Improved methods of assessment and research design have established a robust and causal association between stressful life events and major depressive episodes. The chapter reviews these developments briefly and attempts to identify gaps in the field and new directions in recent research. There are notable shortcomings in several important topics: measurement and evaluation of chronic stress and depression; exploration of potentially different processes of stress and depression associated with first-onset versus recurrent episodes; possible gender differences in exposure and reactivity to stressors; testing kindling/sensitization processes; longitudinal tests of diathesis-stress models; and understanding biological stress processes associated with naturally occurring stress and depressive outcomes. There is growing interest in moving away from unidirectional models of the stress-depression association, toward recognition of the effects of contexts and personal characteristics on the occurrence of stressors, and on the likelihood of progressive and dynamic relationships between stress and depression over time—including effects of childhood and lifetime stress exposure on later reactivity to stress.","psychology"
"Current pharmacological and psychosocial approaches to the treatment of alcohol dependence may best be described as modestly effective, and it is unlikely that a magic bullet for the treatment of any substance use disorder will ever be developed. Rather, it seems more likely that there will be a number of treatment options, each of which will target different mechanisms. Thus, future treatment gains are likely to depend on the ability to match individuals with the treatment most likely to benefit them, which in turn is contingent on our ability to understand the mechanisms that drive the maintenance of substance use disorders on an individual level. On a more global scale, this type of effort has been described as “personalized medicine” and has focused largely on the human genome as a source of information that can be used to match individuals to treatments. This review enumerates barriers to realizing the potential of personalized medicine for substance use disorders and identifies opportunities to overcome those barriers, which involve the development of translational approaches that focus on the development of brain-based phenotypes that serve as the target of both treatment development and of genetic research.","psychology"
"Starting with the Daubert case, courtroom rules and guides regulating the admissibility of scientific evidence have undergone major revisions over the past 10 to 15 years. We review these changes and current legal rules and guides, in particular their impact on the admission of behavioral sciences evidence and testimony. We examine commonly intended meanings, conceptualizations, and language use relating to science and the admission of evidence within the legal system and their relation to more familiar terms and concepts within the behavioral sciences, identifying points of continuity and discontinuity. We then review illustrative legal cases involving challenges to the admission of psychological and psychiatric evidence and their implications for mental health professionals. Finally, we offer a framework for conceptualizing and prioritizing key legal criteria for determining admissibility and appraising standing on these factors within the mental health field. Increased mutual understanding between psychology and law should further enhance productive interfaces between the disciplines and add to the many instances in which the proper use of science in the courtroom has facilitated fair resolution of legal conflicts.","psychology"
"Although some treatments for depression in children and adolescents have been found to be efficacious, the effects sizes have tended to be modest. Thus, there is considerable room to improve upon existing depression treatments. Some children may respond poorly because they do not yet have the cognitive, social, or emotional maturity needed to understand and apply the skills being taught in therapy. Therefore, treatments for depression may need to be tailored to match children's ability to both comprehend and implement the therapeutic techniques. This review outlines the steps needed for such developmental tailoring: (a) Specify the skills being taught in depression treatments; (b) identify what cognitive, social, and emotional developmental abilities are needed to attain these skills; (c) describe the normative developmental course of these skills and how to determine a child's developmental level; and (d) use this information to design an individualized treatment plan. Possible approaches to intervening include: alter the therapy to meet the child's level of development, train the child on the skills needed to engage in the therapy, or apply a dynamic assessment approach that integrates evaluation into treatment and measures children's current abilities as well as their potential.","psychology"
"Prodromal features of the schizophrenia syndrome have been described for a century, and work in the past two decades has produced a substantial literature based on these features to identify individuals at increased risk for developing a psychotic disorder. Sometimes conceptualized as a “risk state” and sometimes as early manifestations of a “disorder,” the work has been conducted with several related but different constructs. Early in the preparation of the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) public comment was sought on the proposal to create a new disorder termed attenuated psychosis syndrome (APS), and a range of issues emerged that generated interesting and important controversies. In this review, these criticisms are fully discussed, the APS concept is explicated; data relating to reliability, validity, and treatment are updated; the heterogeneity of APS is considered; and alternative views of the construct are presented with an emphasis on developmental pattern with timing for primary and secondary prevention and early treatment. Areas of future research are identified, and a potential roadmap for inclusion in DSM-5.1 is traced.","psychology"
"Diathesis-stress models of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders have dominated theorizing about etiology for over three decades. More recently, with advances in our understanding of the biological processes mediating the effects of stress, these models have incorporated mechanisms to account for the adverse impact of stress on brain function. This review examines recent scientific findings on the role of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, one of the primary neural systems triggered by stress exposure, in the expression of vulnerability for schizophrenia. The results indicate that psychotic disorders are associated with elevated baseline and challenge-induced HPA activity, that antipsychotic medications reduce HPA activation, and that agents that augment stress hormone (cortisol) release exacerbate psychotic symptoms. The cumulative findings are discussed in light of a neural diathesis-stress model that postulates that cortisol has the potential to increase activity of dopamine pathways that have been implicated in schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders.","psychology"
"The issues surrounding repressed, recovered, or false memories have sparked one of the greatest controversies in the mental health profession in the twentieth century. We review evidence concerning the existence of the repression and recovery of autobiographical memories of traumatic events and research on the development of false autobiographical memories, how specific therapeutic procedures can lead to false memories, and individual vulnerability to resisting false memories. These findings have implications for therapeutic practice, for forensic practice, for research and training in psychology, and for public policy.","psychology"
"The authors describe how contemporary learning theory and research provide the basis for models of the etiology and maintenance of anxiety and related disorders. They argue that contemporary learning theory accounts for much of the complexity associated with individual differences in the development and course of these disorders. These insights from modern research on learning overcome the limitations of earlier behavioral approaches, which were overly simplistic and have been justifiably criticized. The authors show how considerations of early learning histories and temperamental vulnerabilities affect the short- and long-term likelihood that experiences with stressful events will lead to the development of anxiety disorders. They also discuss how contextual variables during and after stressful learning experiences influence the maintenance of anxiety disorder symptoms. Thus, contemporary learning models provide a rich and nuanced understanding of the etiology and course of anxiety and related disorders.","psychology"
"The present review summarizes empirical developments in the psychosocial treatment of panic and panic disorder by focusing on four key themes that have been emphasized in this literature: (a) treatment efficacy, effectiveness, and innovation; (b) modulating and process variables in treatment; (c) effective dissemination of treatment; and (d) prevention of panic. Cognitive behavioral treatments (CBTs) for panic are very good, even in the context of comorbidity, but the level of efficacy does not appear to be increasing over time. Unfortunately, there have been relatively few substantive innovations in CBT protocols since the 1980s, and despite progress in the use of computer technology, dissemination of these treatments is lagging. The prevention of panic-spectrum psychopathology is a promising area linked with advances in the identification of panic-relevant risk factors that appear to modulate CBT outcomes.","psychology"
"Beginning with efforts in the late 1940s to ensure that clinical psychologists were adequately trained to meet the mental health needs of the veterans of World War II, the accreditation of clinical psychologists has largely been the province of the Commission on Accreditation of the American Psychological Association. However, in 2008 the Psychological Clinical Science Accreditation System began accrediting doctoral programs that adhere to the clinical science training model. This review discusses the goals of accreditation and the history of the accreditation of graduate programs in clinical psychology, and provides an overview of the evaluation procedures used by these two systems. Accreditation is viewed against the backdrop of the slow rate of progress in reducing the burden of mental illness and the changes in clinical psychology training that might help improve this situation. The review concludes with a set of five recommendations for improving accreditation.","psychology"
"This review evaluates the diagnostic criteria for three of the most common disorders for which children and adolescents are referred for mental health treatment: attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), and conduct disorder (CD). Although research supports the validity and clinical utility of these disorders, several issues are highlighted that could enhance the current diagnostic criteria. For ADHD, defining the core features of the disorder and its fit with other disorders, enhancing the validity of the criteria through the lifespan, considering alternative ways to form subtypes of the disorder, and modifying the age-of-onset criterion are discussed relative to the current diagnostic criteria. For ODD, eliminating the exclusionary criteria of CD, recognizing important symptom domains within the disorder, and using the cross-situational pervasiveness of the disorder as an index of severity are highlighted as important issues for improving classification. Finally, for CD, enhancing the current subtypes related to age of onset and integrating callous-unemotional traits into the diagnostic criteria are identified as key issues for improving classification.","psychology"
"One-Session Treatment is a well-established evidence-based treatment for specific phobias in youths that incorporates reinforcement, cognitive challenges, participant modeling, psychoeducation, and skills training into a single, massed session of graduated exposure. This review begins by briefly examining the phenomenology, etiology, epidemiology, and assessment of specific phobias and then pivots to a description of One-Session Treatment. We examine the use of One-Session Treatment with children and adolescents, briefly discussing its components and application, and subsequently review almost two decades of research supporting its efficacy. Finally, we propose future directions for research and practice.","psychology"
"Antecedents of personality disorder in childhood and adolescence have been a neglected area in official taxonomies of mental disorders such as the International Classification of Diseases or the different editions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. An evolving research field, however, underscores the importance of antecedents for understanding psychopathology and personality pathology in adulthood. The current article summarizes the history, updates reviews, and incorporates new research findings into an integrative scheme for conceptualizing personality pathology in childhood and adolescence. Implications of this model for assessment, future research, and intervention are discussed.","psychology"
"According to the idea that addiction is a chronic relapsing disease, remission is at most a temporary state. Either addicts never stop using drugs, or if they do stop, remission is short lived. However, research on remission reveals a more complex picture. In national epidemiological surveys that recruited representative drug users, remission rates varied widely and were markedly different for legal and illegal drugs and for different racial/ethnic groups. For instance, the half-life for cocaine dependence was four years, but for alcohol dependence it was 16 years, and although most dependent cocaine users remitted before age 30, about 5% remained heavy cocaine users well into their forties. Although varied, the remission results were orderly. An exponential growth curve closely approximated the cumulative frequency of remitting for different drugs and different ethnic/racial groups. Thus, each year a constant proportion of those still addicted remitted, independent of the number of years since the onset of dependence.","psychology"
"Children aged birth to five years are exposed to a disproportionately increased amount of potentially traumatic events compared to older children. This review examines the prevalence of traumatic exposure in the birth-to-five age range, the indicators and diagnostic criteria of early traumatic stress, and the contextual issues associated with the experience of early trauma. The article also selectively reviews the impact of trauma on the biological, emotional, social, and cognitive functioning of young children's development along with some promising clinical treatment and service interventions that target the parent-child relationship as a vehicle of trauma recovery. Despite extensive documentation of the negative impact of trauma on the normal development of young children, research, clinical, and policy efforts to address the psychological repercussions of early victimization remain remarkably limited. Future directions in research and clinical practice as well as implications for policy are discussed.","psychology"
"The acquisition and saving of a large number of possessions that interfere with the use of living areas in the home are remarkably common behaviors that can pose serious threats to the health and safety of the affected person and those living nearby. Recent research on hoarding has led the DSM-5 Anxiety, Obsessive-Compulsive Spectrum, Post-traumatic, and Dissociative Disorders Work Group to propose the addition of hoarding disorder to the list of disorders in the upcoming revision of the diagnostic manual. This review examines the research related to the diagnosis and assessment of hoarding and hoarding disorder. The proposed criteria appear to accurately define the disorder, and preliminary studies suggest they are reliable. Recent assessment strategies for hoarding have improved our understanding of the nature of this behavior. Areas in need of further research have been highlighted.","psychology"
"Integrative data analysis (IDA), a novel framework for conducting the simultaneous analysis of raw data pooled from multiple studies, offers many advantages including economy (i.e., reuse of extant data), power (i.e., large combined sample sizes), the potential to address new questions not answerable by a single contributing study (e.g., combining longitudinal studies to cover a broader swath of the lifespan), and the opportunity to build a more cumulative science (i.e., examining the similarity of effects across studies and potential reasons for dissimilarities). There are also methodological challenges associated with IDA, including the need to account for sampling heterogeneity across studies, to develop commensurate measures across studies, and to account for multiple sources of study differences as they impact hypothesis testing. In this review, we outline potential solutions to these challenges and describe future avenues for developing IDA as a framework for studies in clinical psychology.","psychology"
"In this chapter we review research on the diagnosis, course, etiology, and pharmacological and psychosocial treatment of bipolar disorder (BD). BD is a highly recurrent and severe illness, with high rates of suicidality and functional impairment. The disorder is heritable and appears to share susceptibility genes with schizophrenia. It is characterized by dysregulation in the dopamine and serotonin systems and by pathology in the brain systems involved in regulating emotion. Psychosocial stressors, notably life events and familial expressed emotion, significantly influence the course of the illness in the context of these vulnerabilities. Findings of randomized clinical trials indicate that psychosocial interventions enhance long-term outcomes when added to pharmacotherapy. Much remains to be clarified about the interactive contributions of genetic, neurobiological, and psychosocial factors to the course of the disorder, and the moderators and mediators of treatment effects.","psychology"
"Evidence-based policy is being encouraged in all areas of public service ( Black 2001 ). Unprecedented federal legislation reflects a faith in science “as a force for improved public policy” ( Feuer et al. 2002 ). The objective of evidence-based policy is to use scientific research to drive decision making. Thus, the link between social science research and public policy seems to be a natural one. The purpose of this chapter is to address how psychological science in general, and clinical psychology in particular, can be of use to public policy makers. We discuss how psychological science can be relevant and applicable to informing policy, and we describe the role clinical scientists might play in generating, disseminating, and implementing that information. We also note distinct limitations on the usefulness of psychological research in driving public policy. We discuss some pitfalls and recommend areas where clinical psychology might best serve public policy.","psychology"
"Acute stress disorder (ASD) was introduced into the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) taxonomy in 1994 to address the lack of a specific diagnosis for acute pathological reactions to trauma and the role that dissociative phenomena play both in the short- and long-term reactions to trauma. In this review, we discuss the history and goals of the diagnosis and compare it with the diagnoses of acute stress reaction, combat stress reaction, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We also evaluate the research on the validity and limitations of ASD as a diagnosis, the relationship between peritraumatic dissociation and other symptomatology, the extent to which PTSD is predicted by previous ASD or peritraumatic dissociation, and other important issues such as impairment and risk factors related to ASD. We conclude with our recommendations for changes in DSM-5 criteria and the development of more sophisticated research that considers ASD as but one of two or possibly three common acute posttraumatic syndromes.","psychology"
"The development of evidence-based treatments for anxiety disorders is a major achievement of clinical psychology, and cognitive behavior therapy is the best-established and most widely used method. The first form of this therapy, behavior therapy, was a combination of Pavlovian and Behavioristic ideas and methods and was particularly successful in reducing fears. The infusion of cognitive ideas in the late 1970s generated the wider and more flexible cognitive behavior therapy that independent agencies in the United States and United Kingdom now recommend as the treatment of choice for most of the anxiety disorders. Remaining theoretical problems and clinical limitations need to be tackled.","psychology"
"Common mental disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and severe major depression are highly heritable, but differ from single-gene (Mendelian) diseases in that they are the end products of multiple causes. Although this fact may help explain their prevalence from an evolutionary perspective, the complexity of the causes of these disorders makes identification of disease-promoting genes much more difficult. The “endophenotype” approach is an alternative method for measuring phenotypic variation that may facilitate the identification of susceptibility genes for complexly inherited traits. Here we examine the endophenotype construct in context of psychiatric genetics. We first develop an evolutionary theoretical framework for common mental disorders and differentiate them from simpler, single-gene disorders. We then provide a definition and description of endophenotypes, elucidating several features that will make a proposed endophenotype useful in psychiatric genetic research and evaluating the methods for detecting and validating such endophenotypes. We conclude with a review of recent results in the schizophrenia literature that illustrate the usefulness of endophenotypes in genetic analyses of mental disorders, and discuss implications of these findings for models of disease causation and nosology. Given that in mental disorders as in behavior generally, the pathways from genotypes to phenotypes are circuitous at best, discernment of endophenotypes more proximal to the effects of genetic variation will aid attempts to link genes to disorders.","psychology"
"I describe the development and course of my research in studying clinical dysfunction among children, adolescents, and adults. This is an autobiographical account that highlights programs of research, career moves, and experiences along the way that were particularly influential. Research on specific topics and the methods to study them were inherently fascinating but invariably led me to broader issues well beyond what I was studying. The research alerted me to how and why current methods, assumptions, and research practices might be constraining and perhaps slightly misguided. My research and specific findings in a given area were not necessarily part of any particular breakthrough but rather helped me see how more, different, and better work was needed. Collaborations with a diverse set of colleagues and models from other disciplines than psychology helped me conceptualize the goals of research on a given topic (e.g., developing evidence-based treatments, reducing the burden of mental illness, promoting a sustainable environment to mitigate climate change) and propose a shift from current practices as a means to obtain them.","psychology"
"The fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders includes a new class of obsessive-compulsive and related disorders (OCRDs) that includes obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and a handful of other putatively related conditions. Although this new category promises to raise awareness of underrecognized and understudied problems, its empirical validity and practical utility are questionable. This article reviews the phenomenology of OCD and then presents a critical analysis of the arguments underlying the new OCRD class. This analysis leads to a rejection of the OCRD classification on both scientific and logical grounds. The article closes with a discussion of the treatment implications of the OCRDs approach.","psychology"
"As descendants of the indigenous peoples of the United States, American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) have experienced a resurgence in population and prospects since the beginning of the twentieth century. Today, tribally affiliated individuals number over two million, distributed across 565 federally recognized tribal communities and countless metropolitan and nonreservation rural areas. Although relatively little evidence is available, the existing data suggest that AI/AN adults and youth suffer a disproportionate burden of mental health problems compared with other Americans. Specifically, clear disparities have emerged for AI/AN substance abuse, posttraumatic stress, violence, and suicide. The rapid expansion of mental health services to AI/AN communities has, however, frequently preceded careful consideration of a variety of questions about critical components of such care, such as the service delivery structure itself, clinical treatment processes, and preventive and rehabilitative program evaluation. As a consequence, the mental health needs of these communities have easily outpaced and overwhelmed the federally funded agency designed to serve these populations, with the Indian Health Service remaining chronically understaffed and underfunded such that elimination of AI/AN mental health disparities is only a distant dream. Although research published during the past decade has substantially improved knowledge about AI/AN mental health problems, far fewer investigations have explored treatment efficacy and outcomes among these culturally diverse peoples. In addition to routine calls for greater clinical and research resources, however, AI/AN community members themselves are increasingly advocating for culturally alternative approaches and opportunities to address their mental health needs on their own terms.","psychology"
"Postpartum depression (PPD) is a common and serious mental health problem that is associated with maternal suffering and numerous negative consequences for offspring. The first six months after delivery may represent a high-risk time for depression. Estimates of prevalence range from 13% to 19%. Risk factors mirror those typically found with major depression, with the exception of postpartum-specific factors such as sensitivity to hormone changes. Controlled trials of psychological interventions have validated a variety of individual and group interventions. Medication often leads to depression improvement, but in controlled trials there are often no significant differences in outcomes between patients in the medication condition and those in placebo or active control conditions. Reviews converge on recommendations for particular antidepressant medications for use while breastfeeding. Prevention of PPD appears to be feasible and effective. Finally, there is a growing movement to integrate mental health screening into routine primary care for pregnant and postpartum women and to follow up this screening with treatment or referral and with follow-up care. Research and clinical recommendations are made throughout this review.","psychology"
"In seeking to understand mental health and disease, it is fundamental to identify the biological substrates that draw together the experiences and physiological processes that underlie observed psychological changes. Mitochondria are subcellular organelles best known for their central role in energetics, producing adenosine triphosphate to power most cellular processes. Converging lines of evidence indicate that mitochondria play a key role in the biological embedding of adversity. Preclinical research documents the effects of stress exposure on mitochondrial structure and function, and recent human research suggests alterations constituting recalibrations, both adaptive and nonadaptive. Current research suggests dynamic relationships among stress exposure, neuroendocrine signaling, inflammation, and mitochondrial function. These complex relationships are implicated in disease risk, and their elucidation may inform prevention and treatment of stress- and trauma-related disorders. We review and evaluate the evidence for mitochondrial dysfunction as a consequence of stress exposure and as a contributing factor to psychiatric disease.","psychology"
"Group-based trajectory modeling (GBTM) identifies groups of individuals following similar trajectories of one or more repeated measures. The categorical nature of GBTM is particularly well suited to clinical psychology and medicine, where patients are often classified into discrete diagnostic categories. This review highlights recent advances in GBTM and key capabilities that remain underappreciated in clinical research. These include accounting for nonrandom subject attrition, joint trajectory and multitrajectory modeling, the addition of the beta distribution to modeling options, associating trajectories with future outcomes, and estimating the probability of future outcomes. Also discussed is an approach to selecting the number of trajectory groups.","psychology"
"Recent epidemiological research has confirmed that psychosocial factors are associated with increased risk of developing coronary heart disease (CHD), a major cause of death and disability worldwide. This association is probably mediated by changes in health risk behaviors and neuroendocrine and autonomic functions that affect metabolic, hemostatic, inflammatory, and cardiovascular functions that are the proximal agents in CHD pathogenesis over time as well as the precipitation of acute disease events. Recent developments in genomics have now made it possible to begin the process of identifying specific genetic variants that act either independently or via moderation of the impact of exposures to stressful environmental situations to increase the expression of these health-damaging psychosocial factors and the accompanying behavioral and physiological changes that lead to disease. It will be possible ultimately to use the knowledge emerging from research on gene x environment interactions that affect expression of psychosocial risk factors, health risk behaviors, and biological changes inside the body to speed the development of a new field of prospective medicine—a field where instead of spending the majority of health care resources on the treatment of chronic diseases at the end of life, it will be possible to allocate more resources to develop, test, and implement earlier in the disease process cost-effective, proactive interventions that target persons at high risk.","psychology"
"Gambling-related research has advanced rapidly during the past 20 years. As a result of expanding interest in pathological gambling (PG), stakeholders (e.g., clinicians, regulators, and policy makers) have a better understanding of excessive gambling, including its etiology (e.g., neurobiological/neurogenetic, psychological, and sociological factors) and trajectory (e.g., initiation, course, and adaptation to gambling exposure). In this article, we examine these advances in PG-related research and then consider some of the clinical implications of these advances. We consider criteria changes for PG recently proposed by the DSM-V Impulse Control Work Group for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-V). We also review how clinicians can more accurately and efficiently diagnose clients seeking help for gambling-related problems by utilizing brief screens. Finally, we consider the importance of future research that can identify behavioral markers for PG. We suggest that identifying these markers will allow clinicians to make earlier diagnoses, recommend targeted treatments, and advance secondary prevention efforts.","psychology"
"Evidence from epidemiological, clinical, and biological research resulted in the immune hypothesis: the hypothesis that immune system dysfunction is involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSD). The promising implication of this hypothesis is the potential to use existing immunomodulatory treatment for innovative interventions for SSD. Here, we provide a selective historical review of important discoveries that have shaped our understanding of immune dysfunction in SSD. We first explain the basic principles of immune dysfunction, after which we travel more than a century back in time. Starting our journey with neurosyphilis-associated psychosis in the nineteenth century, we continue by evaluating the role of infections and autoimmunity in SSD and findings from assessment of immune function using new techniques, such as cytokine levels, microglia density, neuroimaging, and gene expression. Drawing from these findings, we discuss anti-inflammatory interventions for SSD, and we conclude with a look into the future.","psychology"
"In this review we describe the intricate interrelationship among basic research, conceptualization of psychopathology, treatment development, treatment outcome research, and treatment mechanism research and how the interactions among these areas of study further our knowledge about psychopathology and its treatment. In describing the work of Edna Foa and her colleagues in anxiety disorders, we demonstrate how emotional processing theory of anxiety-related disorders and their treatment using exposure therapy have generated hypotheses about the psychopathology of posttraumatic stress disorder and obsessive-compulsive anxiety disorder that have informed the development and refinement of specific treatment protocols for these disorders: prolonged exposure and exposure and response (ritual) prevention. Further, we have shown that the next step after the development of theoretically driven treatment protocols is to evaluate their efficacy. Once evidence for a treatment's efficacy has accumulated, studies of the mechanisms involved in the reduction of the targeted psychopathology are conducted, which in turn inform the theory and further refine the treatments. We conclude our review with a discussion of how the knowledge derived from Foa and colleagues' programmatic research together with knowledge emerging from basic research on extinction learning can inform future research on the psychopathology of anxiety disorders and their treatments.","psychology"
"A substantive revision of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) last occurred in 1994; therefore, the mental health field should anticipate significant changes to the classification of mental disorders in the fifth edition. Since DSM-5 Work Groups have recently proposed revisions for the major diagnostic classes of mental disorders, an article on the current status of the personality disorders (PDs) is timely. This article reviews scientific principles that have influenced the development of proposed changes for the assessment and diagnosis of personality psychopathology in DSM-5, presents the proposed model as of the summer of 2011, summarizes rationales for the changes, and discusses critiques of the model. Scientific principles were articulated for DSM-5 more than a decade ago; their application to the process has not been straightforward, however. Work Group members have labored to improve the DSM-5 approach to personality and PDs to make the classification more valid and more clinically useful. The current model continues to be a work in progress.","psychology"
"Epigenetic mechanisms govern the transcription of the genome. Research with model systems reveals that environmental conditions can directly influence epigenetic mechanisms that are associated with interindividual differences in gene expression in brain and neural function. In this review, we provide a brief overview of epigenetic mechanisms and research with relevant rodent models. We emphasize more recent translational research programs in epigenetics as well as the challenges inherent in the integration of epigenetics into developmental and clinical psychology. Our objectives are to present an update with respect to the translational relevance of epigenetics for the study of psychopathology and to consider the state of current research with respect to its potential importance for clinical research and practice in mental health.","psychology"
"The internship is an essential part of doctoral training in professional psychology. Most students access internships through the annual match sponsored by the Association of Psychology Postdoctoral and Internship Centers (APPIC). For two decades the match has seen an increasing shortfall of internship positions relative to applicants, exceeding 650 unmatched clinical students as of 2013. Efforts to solve this problem have not met appreciable success. This review discusses the structure of the internship placement process, including and beyond the APPIC match, and identifies the reasons for the failed efforts, which lie principally in the varied standards for an acceptable internship among doctoral programs. Efforts to establish a common standard and the need for a governance structure to enforce whatever standard is agreed upon are discussed. Projections for the future of the placement process and the imbalance are sketched, and links to other issues in the field are briefly reviewed.","psychology"
"Schizophrenia is often referred to as one of the most severe mental disorders, primarily because of the very high mortality rates of those with the disorder. This article reviews the literature on excess early mortality in persons with schizophrenia and suggests reasons for the high mortality as well as possible ways to reduce it. Persons with schizophrenia have an exceptionally short life expectancy. High mortality is found in all age groups, resulting in a life expectancy of approximately 20 years below that of the general population. Evidence suggests that persons with schizophrenia may not have seen the same improvement in life expectancy as the general population during the past decades. Thus, the mortality gap not only persists but may actually have increased. The most urgent research agenda concerns primary candidates for modifiable risk factors contributing to this excess mortality, i.e., side effects of treatment and lifestyle factors, as well as sufficient prevention and treatment of physical comorbidity.","psychology"
"During the past 15 years, much progress has been made in developing and testing Internet-delivered psychological treatments. In particular, therapist-guided Internet treatments have been found to be effective for a wide range of psychiatric and somatic conditions in well over 100 controlled trials. These treatments require (a) a secure web platform, (b) robust assessment procedures, (c) treatment contents that can be text based or offered in other formats, and (d) a therapist role that differs from that in face-to-face therapy. Studies suggest that guided Internet treatments can be as effective as face-to-face treatments, lead to sustained improvements, work in clinically representative conditions, and probably are cost-effective. Despite these research findings, Internet treatment is not yet disseminated in most places, and clinical psychologists should consider using modern information technology and evidence-based treatment programs as a complement to their other services, even though there will always be clients for whom face-to-face treatment is the best option.","psychology"
"Mental imagery is an experience like perception in the absence of a percept. It is a ubiquitous feature of human cognition, yet it has been relatively neglected in the etiology, maintenance, and treatment of depression. Imagery abnormalities in depression include an excess of intrusive negative mental imagery; impoverished positive imagery; bias for observer perspective imagery; and overgeneral memory, in which specific imagery is lacking. We consider the contribution of imagery dysfunctions to depressive psychopathology and implications for cognitive behavioral interventions. Treatment advances capitalizing on the representational format of imagery (as opposed to its content) are reviewed, including imagery rescripting, positive imagery generation, and memory specificity training. Consideration of mental imagery can contribute to clinical assessment and imagery-focused psychological therapeutic techniques and promote investigation of underlying mechanisms for treatment innovation. Research into mental imagery in depression is at an early stage. Work that bridges clinical psychology and neuroscience in the investigation of imagery-related mechanisms is recommended.","psychology"
"Craving is a central feature of addiction. Its recent inclusion as a diagnostic criterion for substance use disorders in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders appears at a time when craving research is at an all-time high. Craving is thought to predict relapse and may deter individuals from even trying to quit. Researchers have developed experimental craving-induction paradigms to identify factors contributing to craving and to test interventions to alleviate craving. This review offers a critique of laboratory craving studies, with particular emphasis on cigarette craving. It raises questions concerning several conceptual and methodological assumptions underlying this research, identifies processes that may explain why cravings are linked to drug use and relapse, addresses contextual factors that may influence various experiences of craving, and considers recent interventions targeting craving. The relation between craving and both emotion and coping is discussed, as well as the level of insight that individuals have about their own future cravings.","psychology"
"Emotional problems figure prominently in many clinical conditions. Recent efforts to explain and treat these conditions have emphasized the role of emotion dysregulation. However, emotional problems are not always the result of emotion dysregulation, and even when emotional problems do arise from emotion dysregulation, it is necessary to specify precisely what type of emotion dysregulation might be operative. In this review, we present an extended process model of emotion regulation, and we use this model to describe key points at which emotion-regulation difficulties can lead to various forms of psychopathology. These difficulties are associated with (a) identification of the need to regulate emotions, (b) selection among available regulatory options, (c) implementation of a selected regulatory tactic, and (d) monitoring of implemented emotion regulation across time. Implications and future directions for basic research, assessment, and intervention are discussed.","psychology"
"The field of behavioral economics has made important inroads into the understanding of substance use disorders through the concept of reinforcer pathology. Reinforcer pathology refers to the joint effects of (a) the persistently high valuation of a reinforcer, broadly defined to include tangible commodities and experiences, and/or (b) the excessive preference for the immediate acquisition or consumption of a commodity despite long-term negative outcomes. From this perspective, reinforcer pathology results from the recursive interactions of endogenous person-level variables and exogenous environment-level factors. The current review describes the basic principles of behavioral economics that are central to reinforcer pathology, the processes that engender reinforcer pathology, and the approaches and procedures that can repair reinforcement pathologies. The overall goal of this review is to present a new understanding of substance use disorders as viewed by recent advances in behavioral economics.","psychology"
"Suicide is the second leading cause of death for youth in the United States. Fortunately, substantial advances have been achieved in identifying and intervening with youth at risk. In this review, we first focus on advances in proactive suicide risk screening and psychoeducation aimed at improving the recognition of suicide risk. These strategies have the potential to improve our ability to recognize and triage youth at risk who may otherwise be missed. We then review recent research on interventions for youth at risk. We consider a broad range of psychotherapeutic interventions, including crisis interventions in emergency care settings. Though empirical support remains limited for interventions targeting suicide risk in youth, effective and promising approaches continue to be identified. We highlight evidence-based screening and intervention approaches as well as challenges in these areas and recommendations for further investigation.","psychology"
"Traditional diagnostic systems went beyond empirical evidence on the structure of mental health. Consequently, these diagnoses do not depict psychopathology accurately, and their validity in research and utility in clinicalpractice are therefore limited. The Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology (HiTOP) consortium proposed a model based on structural evidence. It addresses problems of diagnostic heterogeneity, comorbidity, and unreliability. We review the HiTOP model, supporting evidence, and conceptualization of psychopathology in this hierarchical dimensional framework. The system is not yet comprehensive, and we describe the processes for improving and expanding it. We summarize data on the ability of HiTOP to predict and explain etiology (genetic, environmental, and neurobiological), risk factors, outcomes, and treatment response. We describe progress in the development of HiTOP-based measures and in clinical implementation of the system. Finally, we review outstanding challenges and the research agenda. HiTOP is of practical utility already, and its ongoing development will produce a transformative map of psychopathology.","psychology"
"Outcome measurement in the field of psychotherapy has developed considerably in the last decade. This review discusses key issues related to outcome measurement, modeling, and implementation of data-informed and measurement-based psychological therapy. First, an overview is provided, covering the rationale of outcome measurement by acknowledging some of the limitations of clinical judgment. Second, different models of outcome measurement are discussed, including pre–post, session-by-session, and higher-resolution intensive outcome assessments. Third, important concepts related to modeling patterns of change are addressed, including early response, dose–response, and nonlinear change. Furthermore, rational and empirical decision tools are discussed as the foundation for measurement-based therapy. Fourth, examples of clinical applications are presented, which show great promise to support the personalization of therapy and to prevent treatment failure. Finally, we build on continuous outcome measurement as the basis for a broader understanding of clinical concepts and data-driven clinical practice in the future.","psychology"
"There is no accepted definition of the term paraphilia despite its being listed as an essential feature of a class of mental disorders known as the paraphilic disorders. The origin of the term, history of its inclusion as a diagnosis, and logical flaws inherent in the various definitions are discussed in this review. We examine the basis for pathologizing individuals with paraphilias, consider what paraphilias can tell us about how humans develop their sexual interests, and question the usefulness of dividing sexual interests into paraphilias and normophilias. The construct of the paraphilias appears to be poorly conceived and has outlived its usefulness.","psychology"
"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has identified racism as a serious threat to public health. Structural racism is a fundamental cause of inequity within interconnected institutions and the social environments in which we live and develop. This review illustrates how these ethnoracial inequities impact risk for the extended psychosis phenotype. Black and Latinx populations are more likely than White populations to report psychotic experiences in the United States due to social determining factors such as racial discrimination, food insecurity, and police violence. Unless we dismantle these discriminatory structures, the chronic stress and biological consequences of this race-based stress and trauma will impact the next generation's risk for psychosis directly, and indirectly through Black and Latina pregnant mothers. Multidisciplinary early psychosis interventions show promise in improving prognosis, but coordinated care and other treatments still need to be more accessible and address the racism-specific adversities many Black and Latinx people face in their neighborhoods and social environments.","psychology"
"Partialing is a statistical approach researchers use with the goal of removing extraneous variance from a variable before examining its association with other variables. Controlling for confounds through analysis of covariance or multiple regression analysis and residualizing variables for use in subsequent analyses are common approaches to partialing in clinical research. Despite its intuitive appeal, partialing is fraught with undesirable consequences when predictors are correlated. After describing effects of partialing on variables, we review analytic approaches commonly used in clinical research to make inferences about the nature and effects of partialed variables. We then use two simulations to show how partialing can distort variables and their relations with other variables. Having concluded that, with rare exception, partialing is ill-advised, we offer recommendations for reducing or eliminating problematic uses of partialing. We conclude that the best alternative to partialing is to define and measure constructs so that it is not needed.","psychology"
"The developmental origins of health and disease hypothesis applied to neurodevelopmental outcomes asserts that the fetal origins of future development are relevant to mental health. There is a third pathway for the familial inheritance of risk for psychiatric illness beyond shared genes and the quality of parental care: the impact of pregnant women's distress—defined broadly to include perceived stress, life events, depression, and anxiety—on fetal and infant brain–behavior development. We discuss epidemiological and observational clinical data demonstrating that maternal distress is associated with children's increased risk for psychopathology: For example, high maternal anxiety is associated with a twofold increase in the risk of probable mental disorder in children. We review several biological systems hypothesized to be mechanisms by which maternal distress affects fetal and child brain and behavior development, as well as the clinical implications of studies of the developmental origins of health and disease that focus on maternal distress. Development and parenting begin before birth.","psychology"
"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death among people with severe mental disorder (SMD). CVD risk factors occur at the individual, health system, and socio-environmental levels and contribute not only to high rates of CVD but also to worsening mental health. While acknowledging this wider context, this review focuses on behavioral interventions for seven CVD risk behaviors—smoking, physical inactivity, excessive alcohol consumption, low fruit and vegetable intake, inadequate sleep, poor social participation, and poor medication adherence—that are common among people with SMD. We survey recent meta-reviews of the literature and then review additional key studies to provide clinical recommendations for behavioral interventions to reduce CVD risk among people with SMD. A transdiagnostic psychological approach from the start of mental health treatment, drawing upon multidisciplinary expertise to address multiple risk behaviors, is recommended.","psychology"
"The last three decades in psychological research have been marked by interdisciplinary science. Addiction represents a prime example of a disorder marked by a complex interaction among psychosocial and biological factors. This review highlights critical findings in the basic neuroscience of addiction and translates them into clinical language that can inform clinical psychologists in their research, teaching, and practice. From mechanisms of reward processing, learning and memory, allostasis, incentive-sensitization, withdrawal, tolerance, goal-directed decision making, habit learning, genetics, inflammation, and the microbiome, the common theme of this review is to illustrate the clinical utility of basic neuroscience research and to identify opportunities for clinical science. The thoughtful integration of basic and clinical science provides a powerful tool to fulfill the scientific mission of improving health care. Clinical psychologists have a crucial role to play in the translational science of addiction.","psychology"
"The goal of this review is to enable clinical psychology researchers to more rigorously test competing hypotheses when studying risk factors in observational studies. We argue that there is a critical need for researchers to leverage recent advances in epidemiology/biostatistics related to causal inference and to use innovative approaches to address a key limitation of observational research: the need to account for confounding. We first review theoretical issues related to the study of causation, how causal diagrams can facilitate the identification and testing of competing hypotheses, and the current limitations of observational research in the field. We then describe two broad approaches that help account for confounding: analytic approaches that account for measured traits and designs that account for unmeasured factors. We provide descriptions of several such approaches and highlight their strengths and limitations, particularly as they relate to the etiology and treatment of behavioral health problems.","psychology"
"A vast share of the population-attributable risk for autism relates to inherited polygenic risk. A growing number of studies in the past five years have indicated that inherited susceptibility may operate through a finite number of early developmental liabilities that, in various permutations and combinations, jointly predict familial recurrence of the convergent syndrome of social communication disability that defines the condition. Here, we synthesize this body of research to derive evidence for a novel developmental substructure for autism, which has profound implications for ongoing discovery efforts to elucidate its neurobiological causes, and to inform future clinical and biomarker studies, early interventions, and personalized approaches to therapy.","psychology"
"The 35-year progression of multisystemic therapy (MST) from modest university-based efficacy studies to large-scale transport to community practice settings is described in this review. The success of early efficacy research led to effectiveness trials, and their success in decreasing rates of youth rearrest and incarceration led to multisite transportability trials and adaptations of the MST model for treating youth presenting other types of challenging clinical problems. To support the transport of MST programs to community settings, an intensive quality improvement system modeled after that used in clinical trials has been implemented in community-based MST programs for the past 15 years. With the association between therapist treatment fidelity and youth outcomes well established, transportability research has demonstrated the significant roles played by clinical supervisors, expert consultants, and provider organizations in supporting therapist adherence and youth outcomes. This body of work has been facilitated by federal and state initiatives to support evidence-based services.","psychology"
"An understanding of African American and Hispanic adolescent drug abuse occurs at the intersection of context, development, and behavior. The focus of this review is on the impact of racial/ethnic culture as one of the important contexts that influence adolescent development toward or away from prosocial behaviors. Because family plays a major role in both African American and Hispanic cultures, it is also a centerpiece of any discussion of adolescent development in these groups. This review on the state of the science in drug abuse for African American and Hispanic adolescents focuses on epidemiology, culturally specific risk and protective processes, and prevention and treatment research. From the perspective of a broad lens, specific minority groups such as African Americans and Hispanics would appear to have more in common than not. However, each of these groups encompasses considerable genetic, historical, social, and cultural heterogeneity. Investigation across such diversity will yield a more complete picture of the human condition.","psychology"
