1. not having an early stopper for 3, 4, 5 epochs vs early stopper
initially i did not  use an early stopper for simplicity but found that sociology often overfits while other fields are still learning
i started with 5 epochs with recommendation from GPT, then noticed that loss is still going down so i went to 6, then to 4, then to 3
2. fixed learning rate vs learning rate scheduler
3. cased vs uncased BERT model
4. BERT vs SciBERT
